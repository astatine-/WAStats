He says 

The journalist has picked up RBI Audit comments of last year from our DRHP and tried to sensationalise them. These have all been taken care of and RBI is quite satisfied with our operations or they would have penalised us. As you know they do it very often these days. We are one of few banks with a clean record.

The issue was first reported by Comparitech, which discovered (in partnership with security researcher Bob Diachenko) that the account details were exposed in a database that could be accessed by anyone through a browser without any kind of password or authentication.

The account data include email addresses, account creation date, Adobe products used, subscription status, whether the user is an Adobe employee, member IDs, country, time of last login, and payment status. Things like payment details and account passwords were not exposed by the database.

10/29/19, 10:11 - Vikas Panditrao - ICE: _code of conduct_ *Don't Be Evil no more, Google removes famous phrase from its policy document*

The old English phrase-- don't be evil-- has been a part of Google's code of conduct for *18 long years*. Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, was restructured in 2015. However, the phrase stuck through the transition period appearing thrice in the code of conduct, twice in the beginning and once towards the end. But it seems that the search engine giant has silently removed the phrase from its original text.

Interestingly, this change can be noticed in the company's focus area as well. As per Google's code of conduct, earlier, the company aimed at "providing users unbiased access to information, focusing on their needs and giving them the best products and services that we can". However, following a change in the motto, the preface read, "Google Code of Conduct is built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct"-- which marks a clear diversion in the company's policies and practices.

British regulators should impose higher levies on banks if they need more resources to stop big IT glitches and should consider regulating cloud service providers such as Google, UK lawmakers said in a review on Monday.

The review was launched after a major IT meltdown last year at TSB, part of Spain‚Äôs Sabadell, which left thousands of customers locked out of their online accounts. The issue led to the resignation of TSB‚Äôs CEO Paul Pester.

Many market infrastructure services and technology that banks use are outsourced and the *review said firms cannot use third party failures as an excuse when incidents occur, drawing attention to suppliers of cloud computing.*

1. Three key developments since the 2008 financial crisis have shaped the discourse on CBDCs and the role of private and public institutions in the creation of money.

2. Central banks‚Äô policy objectives regarding digital currencies are many and various. For policy-makers, specifying the use cases in which a CBDC may apply is paramount.

3. Central banks‚Äô policy goals will determine the technology used. Policy-makers would require a retail CBDC to be accessible, secure and operate for all payments transactions.


4. The particular design of a CBDC, such as whether or not it would bear interest, will determine its effectiveness as a monetary policy instrument and whether any financial stability implications may arise.

5. If introduced, central banks expect they
will outsource some CBDC operations to the private sector, such as the distribution of the currency, onboarding of users and customer- facing services.

The toothbrush connects to an app on your phone over Bluetooth. When you start brushing, the app will show a timer of how long you‚Äôve been brushing and guide you to where should brush next. That seems handy. 
Oral-B says the toothbrush uses sensors to know when you‚Äôre applying too much pressure or not brushing long enough in a certain spot, and then sends data from the sensors to the app. The app takes this sensor data and uses the ‚ÄúGenius X AI algorithm‚Äù to tell you where you need to brush better and give you a rating on how well you brushed.

10/31/19, 09:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Imo Payment co‚Äôs valuation is still a bubble in India. 

The reality in the business is 
1.  There is very little loyalty because you arent sticky to any app. And its easy to switch. This is truer after Everyone is riding on UPI. Scan any code with any app. The closed merchant ecosystem of paytm aint working any more. PhonePe and GPay are making the big daddy of money bite its nails. 
2. Its about cash burn and thats why it phonepe and gpay are giving paytm a run. The worrying part is another rich kid in the block can throw them over. 
3. Honestly no payment cos are creating an infra which is likely to stay. Unlike e-commerce which rides on its supply chain or warehouses, payment cos are running on UPI rails which are open to everyone. Everyservice is availble with every operator. 

The biggest win here is the consumer. What has grown is awareness and whats best is simplicity ease and realtime txns. Players have grown the UPI and payment ecosystem. Albeit there may not be a lone winner

Question Raised by another community member is 

*Why doesn‚Äôt Regulatory Authorities intervene by banning cash backs or link it with profits that companies make.  Will this not create level playing field for Paytm, Phone pe , Amazon and other? . Let these companies gain market share on the basis of Product features and product strength*

Changing behaviour is a lengthy and expensive process and technology costs are only a small fraction of that. And I say that as a technology provider. The costs in India (as outlined in that article) are *low* due to the stick the govt has been wielding matching the carrots offered by these providers. Without that stick the costs will be perhaps unmanageably high, or usage much lower at these costs.

10/31/19, 10:37 - Vikas Panditrao - ICE: *FIAKS community member says* 

I believe it is on the way commi ssion mechanism works for upi transactions. Commission is paid to the app provider rather than to the credit or debit bank.  Charges are deducted from debiting bank (not the customer), as UPI is free of cost at most banks. So, irrespective of their app being used or not banks are paying charges to NPCI. In case of wallets like PAYTM, people mostly use credit cards to add money rather than using UPI. In this case PAYTM pays for credit card commission. But in case of companies like Google pay, they earn commission without maintaining wallet. Earlier there are cases where a customer will have multiple UPI ids for the same account and will transfer between these  ids, just for getting the cash back.

I remember the days when customers were paying charges for making fund transfers, and, now customers are dissatisfied when they don't pay charges and they get the message "Better luck next time" in Google Pay.

NPCI should think of doing something to this disparity. Most banks are bleeding due to this.

The questionnaire reportedly said the Commission had received information that Apple may have restricted online payments made through apps or other online retailers.

*Pegasus Spyware's Scary User Manual Shows Why Snoopy Govts Love Them*

The guide highlights why a government would choose this spyware over other options ‚Äî which is also a reminder that governments around the world have invested heavily (and continue to do so) in the field of surveillance. 

It achieves  unmatched mobile intelligence collection:

‚ñ™Unlimited access to target‚Äôs mobile devices: Remotely and covertly collect information about your target‚Äôs relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities ‚Äì whenever and wherever they are.
‚ñ™Intercept calls: Transparently monitor voice and VoIP calls in real-time.
‚ñ™Bridge intelligence gaps: Collect unique and new types of information (e.g., contacts, files, environmental wiretap, passwords, etc.) to deliver the most accurate and complete intelligence.
‚ñ™Handle encrypted content and devices: Overcome encryption, SSL, proprietary protocols and any hurdle introduced by the complex communications world.
‚ñ™Application monitoring: Monitor a multitude of applications including Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook and Blackberry Messenger (BBM).
‚ñ™Pinpoint targets: Track targets and get accurate positioning information using GPS.
‚ñ™Service provider independence: No cooperation with local Mobile Network Operators (MNO) is needed.
‚ñ™Discover virtual identities: Constantly monitor the device without worrying about frequent switching of virtual identities and replacement of SIM cards.
‚ñ™Avoid unnecessary risks: Eliminate the need for physical proximity to the target or device at any phase.


According to the user guide, tracking is possible in real-time, with stored history being accessible as well as continuous future monitoring. Data is transmitted as long as the battery is above 5%, and the device is not on a roaming network. On roaming, it only transmits the data via Wi-Fi‚Äîcrucial data can even be shared via text messages, although it can ‚Äúoccur in his billing report, and thus should be used sparingly.‚Äù

11/4/19, 00:30 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community thought leader and our Advisory Committee member Shri A P Hota ji provides great guidance on this matter* 

He says NEFT getting 24x7 was necessary from public policy angle. Objective is to make faster payment universally accessible. Though UPI has taken India leagues ahead of other countries, fact remains that *customers of all the banks donot have access to UPI*. Basic remittance facility should be available to all at speed and convenience. UPI demands a technology level of the service providing banks that many small banks have neither the capacity not would regulator permit them in the near future. Basic service should not be the privilege of large banks only - banking license having been granted and customers of all banks having the same basic requirement. It is for this reason that Fed is going for FedNow though the private sector in US has already created 3-4 real time service as private clubs. Congress has directed Fed to do with with a bill having been passed. Our RBI and NPCI are so progressive. 

But NEFT is available to customers of almost all banks through a variety of aggregators. 

NPCI has is nothing to worry. While NPCI will keep enabling more and more banks on UPI, NPCI has developed use cases far richer than the basic funds transfer service which NEFT aims at. UPI volume would keep zooming. 

As on today, it is not clear whether RBI aims at making NEFT real time - meaning beneficiary account being credited real time.  Current practice is the funds transfer message is delivered real time to the beneficiary bank but credit by the beneficiary bank to customer account instantly is discretionary. Mandate is to confirm the position within ( I think one hour). Which means, the beneficiary bank has an window to verify. 

Besides, Settlement takes place every half an hour on a net basis. It is still not clear, how net settle the every half an hour would take place on Saturday and Sunday. Either RTGS timing would have to be reviewed or RBI has to go for a settlement guarantee fund or pooling of funds separately just for settlement during non-RTGS hours. We will have to wait for detailed framework.  Creation of SGF will demand banks forking out some funds. May be RBI itself will create a development fund from its own account to promote digital payments. Small banks will certainly make this demand. 

Who knows, plain vanilla extension of time 24x7 with no other change will take place with nearly 50 half hourly settlements being further netted and settled on Monday morning ( crude way of doing, but possible!). But banks will have to keep monitoring staff 24x7. 

Let us watch. In a fortnight or so, RBI will start consulting banks. 

Let UPI journey go unhindered. Let IPO   Collection through UPI happen. It would be a great Story for SEBI apart from RBI, banks and NPCI. Let us wish NCI- ‚Äúthe Jewel‚Äù described by Nilekani keep shining. 24x7 NEFT on one side and UPI - IMPS combined on the other will the twin engine to push the retail payments in India.

Earlier marketeers used *Print media* extensively as part of marketing  and corporate communication strategy. 

Today large part of monies are spent by brands on Digital / social channels like Facebook, Linkedin, instagram

What role *whatsapp* will play as part of marketing strategy in BFSI sector

We saw the impact *whatsapp* had on YES Bank and some other companies recently. 

Can  Corporates ignore this channel?? What‚Äôs the view ?
11/5/19, 20:40 - Vikas Business Phone: FIAKS Maven on *What's app* as part of corporate/ digital strategy says 

_Lots views received across community. Many have requested to remain anonymous. We will include views as part of bespoke report. Posting views of top professionals on this topic_

*Views 8* Chief Digital Office MNC Bank (anonymous)


Whatsapp and similar channels (wechat, FB messenger) will become mainstay customer communication channels where institutions will bring their products and channels to the customer. Customers will want services in their comfort of their own space i.e. their whatsapp account or their home etc. As long as they are sure about privacy and security. Building for robust whatsapp for business accounts with the full functionality of Apps or Branches will be the next set of innovation to service customers where they are.

*Another Views* CXO (Anonymous) 

While Print/TV will always continue to play a critical role to get to a larger universe (reach), Personalized and Segmented communication will be primarily delivered through Whatsapp or other Chat platforms. Email channels are passe owing to the inability to control for Junk. Chat however has enough controls to prevent Junk and hence will prove to be a useful way to target and reach customers
11/5/19, 21:23 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member says* 

*Views 10*  Chief Marketing officer

When rumour can bring down payment company valuation by 71%. 

Also, recently bank had to file a police complaint to avoid run on deposits. 

Undoubtedly marketeers need to take a note of importance of What‚Äôs app as part of corporate communication strategy. 

*View 16* founder 

Formal channels are mostly paid today. 

However communities on the informal channels like messaging platforms can make or mar a brand. Marketeer very well understand the value these informal channels play and are already  integrating it with overall corporate communication strategy.

Banks are a place where you store your cash, right? Not exactly.

When you deposit money in a checking or savings account, you aren‚Äôt just letting the bank hold it on your behalf. You are lending the bank that money and the bank is borrowing it.

Now, the system can be shaken up if too many people decide to hold physical paper money, or they transfer deposit money into other instruments banks can‚Äôt leverage as easily.

Israeli banks pass on information about accounts that they suspect belong to residents of foreign countries, and do not really live in Israel.

The reason for the significant change in the conduct of the banks is that last July, an information exchange agreement entered into by the State of Israel with 53 other countries came into force, meaning a flow of mutual information on bank accounts and assets between the various countries and financial institutions.

In recent weeks, Johannesburg‚Äôs computer network was held for ransom by a hacker group called Shadow Kill Hackers. This was the second time in three months a ransomware attack has hit South Africa‚Äôs largest city. This time, however, hackers didn‚Äôt pose the usual threat.

Rather than denying the city access to its data, the standard blackmail in a ransomware attack, they threatened to publish it online. This style of attack, known as leakware, allows hackers to target more victims in a single attack ‚Äì in this case the city‚Äôs citizens.

Many manipulate statistical data to gain a reputation as a researcher who publishes the most under Indonesia‚Äôs unhealthy academic ranking system.

Scholars have proposed research data repositories where researchers can share data openly. These data pools allow researchers to verify and reproduce the results of published studies, thereby minimising room for violations.

But now, I can unlock my phone‚Ä¶ with my face! I love it, but I‚Äôm also slightly scared at the possibilities of what other people could do if they get access to my face without my knowledge. Better keep my face to myself.

It was only a matter of time before we heard about the financial services industry adopting innovative biometrics technology for access management of private information. In other words: Banks are using facial recognition.

11/19/19, 09:16 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Passwordless_ *Passwords should become a thing of the past. Here's why*

Passwords were once one of our most trusted security measures, but over the past decade, the average person‚Äôs digital footprint has been exposed to increasing numbers of third parties. Now the average consumer manages over *191 pairs* of usernames and passwords. It is almost guaranteed that people reuse the same passwords or tactics to authenticate across various services.

Most of the recent data breaches stem from stolen passwords. As digital platforms pile up gigabytes of data, including personal information and the credentials we use to get access to their digital services, the cost of attacks for hackers has decreased significantly. *You can now buy login credentials to someone‚Äôs bank or Uber account on the dark web for as little as $7*. Knowledge-based authentication, whether with PINs, passwords, passphrases, or whatever we need to remember, are not only a major headache for users - they cost a lot of money to maintain. Without even looking at the costs of a cyberattack, the mere costs of password management, of time lost by employees typing passwords and chasing the IT department when they fail, can climb up to $70 per incident. And with up to 50% of all help-desk calls being password resets, the costs can mount up quickly.

11/19/19, 09:30 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community CXO bank shared the following update on "what is NPA DIVERGENCE?"* 

Ref -IOB report divergence of NPAs for FY19

Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) revised its net loss for FY19 to Rs. 6,000 crore from Rs. 3,738 crore, as reported earlier. So far, five banks have disclosed divergences in asset recognition for FY19.

_All you wanted to know about...NPA divergence_

Many of us are in the habit of pushing away a hard task for a later date, in the hope that it will become easier with time. That is precisely what banks seem to have been doing with their bad loans, hiding them in the complex jumble of numbers that make up their books of account, in the hope that the bad loans could turn good with passage of time.

But the RBI is not having any of that. It has asked banks to come clean about the true state of affairs. While this is hurting banks‚Äô earnings and the investor sentiment, this clean-up could hopefully help over the long run.

*What is it?*
The RBI in a circular last year on ‚ÄòDisclosure in the Notes to Accounts to the Financial Statements ‚Äì Divergence in Asset Classification and Provisioning‚Äô, had stated that there have been instances of material divergences in banks‚Äô asset classification and provisioning from the RBI norms, thereby leading to the published financial statements not depicting a true and fair view of the financial position.

The RBI had also laid down specific conditions when disclosures have to be made ‚Äî the mandated provisioning by the RBI exceeded 15 per cent of published profit after tax for the period under question or additional gross NPA identified by the RBI exceeded 15 per cent of the published figure.

As if on cue, since the issue of the circular, banks have been disclosing sharp bad loan divergences from their reported numbers for two consecutive fiscals (FY16 and FY17).

For instance, Axis Bank reported gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) in FY16. As assessed by the RBI, the GNPAs were higher ‚Äî implying a sharp divergence. The bank has gone on to report another divergences pertaining to FY17. YES Bank reported a divergence in  FY17.

SBI reported bad loan divergence in FY17.

*Why is it important?*
Over the last two to three years, the RBI has single-mindedly focussed on cleaning up banks‚Äô balance sheets.

First came the asset quality review, or AQR, in 2015, that mostly impacted public sector banks.

A chunk of the slippages emerged from the so-called restructured accounts ‚Äî wherein the original terms and conditions of loans are relaxed to provide a breather to borrowers facing financial stress.

The flushing out of the rot in banks‚Äô books through AQR proved inadequate as banks, continued to witness sharp slippages.

The central bank‚Äôs annual risk-based supervision leading to disclosure of huge divergences by banks, has become another key parameter die-hard investors and analysts need to watch out for.

*Why should I care?*

‚ÄòNPAs‚Äô, ‚ÄòAQR‚Äô, divergence, et al are not just high-flying banking jargon. Each has far-reaching implications on the financial health of your bank.

When a borrower defaults in his payments, banks are required to set aside a portion of their earnings as provisions towards these loans to provide a buffer in case of future losses. A sharp rise in NPAs can hence erode a bank‚Äôs profits.

Sharp divergences spell doom when banks carry insufficient capital to absorb sudden losses on account of increase in bad loan provisioning. Since much of banks‚Äô activities are funded by deposits, and have to be repaid at a future date, it is imperative that a bank carries sufficient amount of capital to remain viable.

*Bottomline*
The next time your bank reports bad loan divergences, sit up and take note.

11/19/19, 12:00 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS MAVEN CXO Fintech on lucky man post says*

What about Airtel? are they not suffering? Why only Vodafone is crying? I am sure Airtel would be also suffering. 

Also yes I don‚Äôt deny Mukesh Ambani is smart and maybe lucky also but one can‚Äôt be lucky so many times (Oil, Retail, telco, and a lot of business). JIO has worked as a startup (disruption, innovation &amp; change) and Vodafone has worked like a typical corporate style where the meeting happened and no one takes a decision. 

I am a Vodafone customer for almost 15 years and not seen any innovation until JIO came to market. Why are the profits reaped in so many no reinvested? What were they doing when 4G auction happening why they have not changed which was easy being the largest telco operator could have sense.  

I was paying huge money for poor service and I realize when JIO came and disrupted. My basic rental was 1500 and when I thought of MNP then Vodafone extended offer which was of one-third price, what they were waiting for? for me to say goodbye and then react? Innovation and change is the key, not the smartest and luckiest one.
11/19/19, 12:18 - Vikas Business Phone: *Another FIAKS MAVEN CXO telecom now with leading bank says*

 I disagree with the price war though. None of the Telecom companies in India are profitable. they're all posting losses even before the AGR verdict.

Vodafone, before the merger with Idea had debt if 96,000 crores.

Fundamentally we all rely on our mobiles for calls and data and should be willing to pay so that there is a viable business model for service providers.

Even Jio has a huge debt on its hands, it's relatively new and therefore their focus is consumer numbers. There will come a time when they will change focus to revenue and profit.
11/19/19, 13:33 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member ( Fintech Founder) on Lucky Man post* 

Our model for Telecom and Banking is flawed on an populist plank. By saying everyday that payments , banking and Telecom is free for everyone, because we have a billion consumers we have created a program for failure. We India proclaims we are a free market, the world understands "free" as no revenue market and this will kill FDI.

11/19/19, 17:23 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Digital Currency_ *A Country May Issue a Digital Currency in 5 Years*

Several countries have already experimented with forms of digital currency. In 2017, Uruguay launched the *e-peso* as a pilot project, making the digital currency available to the public as a complement to cash. The pilot ended in April 2018 and since then, the country's central bank has been considering whether a digital currency can be implemented and what impact it would have on the national monetary system.

The Central Bank of The Bahamas also announced " *Project Sand Dollar* " in March of this year. This program consisted of a CBDC built on blockchain technology that aimed to make the financial system more efficient.

"It remains unclear whether blockchain technology or its analogues are the best route forward for digital currency implementation, and central banks by and large are technology agnostic," say the authors of the OMFIF-IBM report. "Ideally, they will settle on their precise policy objectives and then find the most appropriate technological solution, rather than be wedded to a specific technology beforehand."

11/19/19, 18:29 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Regulation On contactless payments_  *A proposed German law would require Apple to enable third parties to use its NFC technology*

It has been passed by German Parliament but must still be approved by its upper house, and would take effect in early 2020, according to Engadget. The law should directly impact Apple Pay because Apple doesn't currently enable other companies to use the iPhone's and Apple Watch's NFC technology, which allows the mobile wallet to facilitate contactless payments.

This *German law could set off a chain reaction that would see Apple have to open access to its NFC technology around the globe, which could be particularly damaging to its business*. Apple Pay only launched in Germany in December 2018, so it's unlikely to be a major market for the mobile wallet at the moment, especially since 67% of consumer-to-business transactions in the country were made with cash in 2018, per McKinsey.

*_Why MNCs are changing their India tune_*

If you are someone who has watched multinational firms‚Äô India play in the heady days of the 1990s and 2000s, the current goings-on are a big let-down. Back then, for the globetrotting MNCs India was the last El Dorado, to be conquered and won at all cost. Though China, another big consumer market, also beckoned, it was considered ‚Äútaken‚Äù, by either government-led local firms or other MNC peers.

No wonder most played the Indian market much in the PGA Tour's Together Anything‚Äôs Possible style, their ambition not constrained by money, men or material. The liberalisation and globalisation-led 90s and noughties was a time when western capital markets were infatuated with a strong emerging market play, and fortunes were made or lost on mere the mention of whether the firm was going in or out of India!

Global firms poured money into India as if there was no tomorrow, and often chased losing, thin on strategy ideas and projects that they would have been loath to back in most developed markets. *It was clear that there was a huge error in estimating the true size of the addressable Indian market*, and some correction in expectations did happen in the 2000s and later, but most kept the faith and the purse strings open.

Something has changed dramatically of late. *Though in the past four-five years alone, there have been some flight out of the country by MNCs* ‚Äî such as French retailer *Carrefour closing* down its cash-and-carry business in 2014 or Japanese drugmaker *Daiichi Sankyo exiting* India in 2015 ‚Äî it is not so much a Quit India movement as yet. More like an expectation that India has to start behaving like any other market and stand up on its own and stop depending on the parent‚Äôs largesse. The reasons are myriad. For some, it is the global strategy at play, but for most it is India-specific issues like regulatory overhang, underperformance of the market or the inability to compete in perhaps of the world‚Äôs most complex market.

After pouring over Rs 1 trillion in the last decade or so, British telco Vodafone announced last week that it has finally closed the funding spigot to its gasping Indian subsidiary, and is ready to face... well... even exit from the country if it comes to that. One of the earliest MNC carmakers into India, American *Ford Motors has agreed to take a junior role in a partnership with local automaker Mahindra & Mahindra* for its struggling operations in India. Why, even General Motors is learned to be looking for buyers for its only remaining factory in India in Pune.
 
Though not as dramatic as a retreat from India, there is clear change of tack among many others across sectors. Time was when American beverages major *Coca-Cola* was gobbling bottlers in India, and writing down losses it had run up to fuel its aggressive take-markets-at-all-cost strategy. Now, the firm is reportedly hawking those bottling plants to its franchise bottlers in order to generate cash.

Japanese investor SoftBank, after pouring in almost $10 billion in Indian startups, including nine unicorns, is demanding all new funding to be linked to time-bound public exits or the chance to sell stake to any willing buyer. Singed by huge losses run up by its Vision Fund globally due to unprofitable bets on WeWork and Uber, SoftBank, according to venture capital tracing firm Tracxn, has not put even a single dollar in new investment in India this year! And after a bitter separation with its partner for half of the country, McDonald‚Äôs has now reportedly put stricter rules for prospective new partners with no leeway to take the operations public and to hypothecate the operating company‚Äôs shares to the parent.

In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 45-IE (I) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank has today superseded the Board of Directors of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) owing to governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations.

The Reserve Bank also intends to shortly initiate the process of resolution of the company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 and would also apply to the NCLT for appointing the Administrator as the Insolvency Resolution Professional.

In a letter sent Tuesday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to respond to questions about how the company collects location data through the new operating systems for Apple‚Äôs iPhones and Google‚Äôs Android.

Both Google and Apple updated their operating systems earlier this year to give users more control and insight into which apps can access their location data. Anticipating those changes, Facebook released a blog post in September explaining that even if users opt out of letting Facebook collect their data, it could still determine users‚Äô locations in other ways, like through check-ins and users‚Äô internet connections.

In the past year, UK banks suffered 265 IT shutdowns that prevented customers making payments.

When online banking goes down, you may need to rely on cash, but what if cash no longer exists? Our Consumer Agenda for Government calls for the next government to guarantee access to cash for all through legislation. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: ‚ÄòThe countless communities across the UK with shockingly low cash machine provision show that measures intended to guarantee access to cash simply don‚Äôt work.‚Äô Ultimately, we do not think any of the schemes currently in operation will be enough to protect cash access in the UK. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre continuing to call for government intervention. We think the next government should implement legislation to protect cash access for as long as it is needed.

Till now a person paying small toll of 30-40 rs in cash had to spend 500 to get fastag, which was a major hurdle.

What's the view ?
11/22/19, 10:04 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: It is not 500 . It is about 100-250 per tag from different providers and money back features. Also variable security deposits and prepaid balance. So actual cost is 150.

If implemented properly, lots of traffic woos can be sorted out as well ciphoning of till Money can be tracked since currently it is blamed that many toll collection revenue is shown incorrect to get more money. Also trails of cars is maintainable if taken positively to bust the crime.
There are many advantages compared to one 150 rupees. 
It is a good initiative and used in many countries.

11/22/19, 10:48 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: 1. Firstly a lot of tolls are much more than 30-40
2. The initial cost is 500 indeed with 150 as the stored value. Effective investment is thus 350 which is a small price to pay for convenience 
3. The toll price remains the same as you pay in cash. However much like most other countries NHAI should give a small incentive (even ~2% odd works) which can easily be absorbed. Else paying in cash can be made 5% more expensive. 
4. There should be 10x fine if you pay cash in a fasttag line else abuse will be very high
5. Change, corruption, speed, traffic snarles can all be avoided with fast tags

It's a good move. Infra companies under report collection and keep on levying toll for agreements under Built operate an transfer model. Classic example is Vashi toll. A small piece of bridge seems toll shall be collected perenially since half of the collection is underreported for various reasons..

*View 17*
Is FasTag only for tolls or also for the Police traffic fines also? If no, is it being explored for that segment too?

Also any Cross Partnerships with auto insurance, car manufacturers, auto ancillaries - product crosssell/cash backs associated? Tolls would be 1 aspect.

*View 19*
It's still a call that the car owners have to take... Cash toll is still possible... The change is that now there will be 1/2 cash lanes and most will be Fastag lanes...
11/22/19, 11:09 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS COMMUNITY pouring in responses on FASTags from 1st* 

Will cover rest of views as part of bespoke 

*View 21*
Couple of things to do, which I have seen in DND and Delhi - Gurgaon toll gate in earlier times. (1) have more number of fastag toll gates as proportion of total toll gates (2) reduce per trip toll rate on fasttag (3) increase cash handling charge at cash gated. Implementation of (1) will automatically make que times for cash higher, so  an opportunity cost where economic cost > toll cost.

*View 25* 
Pay Rs 150 and get the same back as cash back . ICICI and paytm payments bank are the two dominant players in this game

*Question*- Was expecting these offers to be displayed on app / web. Can‚Äôt see. Also Fastag needs to be searched and not shown on the main / dashboard page.

11/24/19, 16:29 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community Thought leader (CXO banker) shared this interesting story with LUCK as theme.*

One night I was invited to a dinner, where I sat next to the wife of a big shot at a giant Wall Street investment bank, called Salomon Brothers. She more or less forced her husband to give me a job. I knew next to nothing about Salomon Brothers. But Salomon Brothers happened to be where Wall Street was being reinvented‚Äî into the place we have all come to know and love. When I got there I was assigned, almost arbitrarily, to the very best job in which to observe the growing madness: they turned me into the house expert on derivatives. A year and a half later Salomon Brothers was handing me a check for hundreds of thousands of dollars to give advice about derivatives to professional investors.

The book I wrote was called Liar‚Äôs Poker. It sold a million copies. I was 28 years old. I had a career, a little fame, a small fortune and a new life narrative. All of a sudden people were telling me I was born to be a writer. This was absurd. Even I could see there was another, truer narrative, with luck as its theme. *What were the odds of being seated at that dinner next to that Salomon Brothers lady? Of landing inside the best Wall Street firm from which to write the story of an age? Of landing in the seat with the best view of the business? Of having parents who didn‚Äôt disinherit me but instead sighed and said ‚Äúdo it if you must?‚Äù Of having had that sense of must kindled inside me by a professor of art history at Princeton? Of having been let into Princeton in the first place?*

This is called Mathew Effect.  This theory explains how privileged end up getting more privileges and under privileged lose whatever little privileges they may have had . 

The term has biblical links..

Not *All* but luck is very important. *Almost every* successful person (those who amass great fortune) is perhaps extremely talented and hardworking but *NOT every* extremely talented and hardworking is successful! So, as they say talent and hardwork are *necessary but not sufficient* for success. *Chance events /luck play a much larger role in important life outcomes (sometimes difference between life and death) than most people imagine.*
11/25/19, 09:22 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Common Tech_.  *Why Not Have Common Technology Platform For Banking License On Tap?*

Why each new bank has to buy a core banking platform separately? Instead, let NPCI or another neutral institution make a one-time investment on core banking platforms by buying it from Infosys or Iflex or Temenos or Misys, etc and then offer basic tech services to these new banks as banking as a service.

This seems a scary direction to take as  ‚ÄòSocialism‚Äô which means the political idea that is based on the belief that all people are equal and that money and property should be equally divided.

On the contrary, this is actually the SAAS model, eg Salesforce, where a platform is enabled for use across multiple businesses and use cases. Security vulnerabilities are there in any system, and have to be dealt with. So don't think this is socialism but baby steps towards SAAS solutions for banking

*View3*  CXO MNC banker

I am not in agreement of this idea, three reasons. 
1. In my mind this actually doesn't contain risk but creates a concentration risk of too many ppl dependent on same platform.
2. We are all aware half the innovation in banking is ppl going around the system. With same platform across innovation could get limited
3. Why do we always forget the words profit and free market when it comes to banking? Without differentiation how will they compete. Will anyone ask Google and Facebook to work on the same tech platform

11/25/19, 10:46 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I wonder if it might make more sense to flip the model. Every bank has its own platform - that's what allows it to create the products and offerings that make it what it is. Not sure what can be achieved by having a shared platform. But they can share front-ends - I don't know if multi-bank branches have come up anywhere? Kind of like the ATMs - "white labeled" branches. Similar to the shared tower infra that telcos have while keeping their core distinct and "personalized" to their strategy.

So what if GDP goes up, if most citizens are worse off? In the first three years of the so-called recovery from the financial crisis, about 91% of the gains went to the top 1%. No wonder that many people doubted the claims of politicians who were then saying the economy was well on the way to a robust recovery.

11/25/19, 13:39 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on today‚Äôs  news of Digital payments venture Paytm has scooped $1 billion (Rs 7,170 crore) in a fresh round of funding led by American investment firm T Rowe Price besides existing investors Ant Financial (formerly Alipay) and SoftBank, the firm said.The deal was struck at a valuation of $16 billion (Rs 1.14 trillion). There are just 28 public listed firms in the country that are valued higher than this* 

He shared an extract of report on *India Fintech: That was circulated after meeting  the top Indian fintech founders - key takeaways and implications for financial services*

1. *Paytm's lead, UPI disruption and banking play*:
Before we met Paytm, there were multiple questions, flagged to us by investors and industry participants:
1. Impact of UPI on Paytm's mobile wallet business
2. Paytm payment bank's limited traction and run-ins with the regulator
3. Paytm's monetization strategy with lack of ability to lend
We met the leadership at Paytm and also collected feedback from participants across the trip. We came back with a sense, that *a lot of capabilities Paytm has built under the hood is unappreciated by banks and its more direct fintech competitors*. Paytm's consumer engagement continues with its higher contribution lifestyle business (travel, entertainment, food, content, games, deals, advertisement). On the merchant side, UPI QR acceptance has increased but Paytm has built an integrated merchant business (across wallets, QR, UPI and now card acceptance). Paytm has feet on the ground on merchant management, which many of its UPI competitors are yet to build. Paytm also has a merchant relationship management software stack with invoice, reconciliation CRM, rewards & merchant lending which further builds merchant hooks. Further, UPI has enabled Paytm to save payment gateway fees in costs.
On the payments bank, we got a distinct sense that the management team has matured in its regulatory understanding and regulatory process management. The Paytm bank has a more traditional CEO now (from the banking industry) with ability to maintain strong in-house processes while the product team churns out a high quality banking product (the new banking app in beta looks slick) versus recent outages of mobile banking apps at private banks.
On acquiring, Paytm started with its closed loop integrated wallet check out via QR at merchants. Post UPI, Paytm has integrated the UPI QR ability (single QR code) across its merchant base. Paytm further has expanded its merchant acquiring platform with card acceptance capability (~1,20,000 terminals). Given, the co-existence of cards, UPI QR and wallets, Paytm is building a neutral merchant acceptance platform. Paytm is also focused on ensuring higher activation levels at merchants. Paytm has a strong 'feet on street' force combined with active centralized monitoring to ensure high activation rate at merchants.
On the lending side, Paytm doesn't look averse to take the bold step to lending from its own balance sheet after realization that the bank partnership model has its challenges.
11/25/19, 13:39 - Vikas Business Phone: *We believe if Paytm continues to make steady progress with its payments bank and with strong compliance standards with RBI, a potential upgrade to a small finance bank or an incremental lending license may not be ruled out.*

A more intriguing, related question is whether bitcoin is an indicator of risk appetite or a beneficiary of risk aversion. Indeed, within the less ‚Äòindependent‚Äô crypto currency community there is a view abroad that bitcoin and crypto currencies are a ‚Äòsafe haven‚Äô in the same way people might for instance, regard gold.

This doesn't just mean that nonprofits -- for whom the .org top-level domain was created -- will pay higher prices to maintain their domains, and it doesn't just mean that private equity funds -- rather than a transparent, nonprofit NGO -- will be able to censor what gets posted to .org domains, by kicking out any domain that it doesn't like (remember when everyone was cheering because Nazi websites were being stripped of their domain names by registrars? This cuts both ways: if registrars have the power and duty to respond to speech they object to by taking away organizations' domains, then that duty and power also applies to billionaires and private equity-appointed administrators).

Unfolding technological developments pose a significant challenge in terms of the depth of economic and social transformation needed for their benefits to be fully realized and equitably distributed. Questions are emerging regarding the adequacy of our current economic policies and practices, the social contract between citizens, businesses and governments and the metrics used to assess socio-economic progress.

Implications for governments on future paths for policy-making in three important and interrelated areas are developed in this white paper:

The future of innovation policy: How does innovation policy need to evolve to ensure more productive and inclusive economies?The future of labour policy: How must labour policy be updated for the new world of work?The future of fiscal policy: How will approaches to taxation and government spending have to adapt to the transformation of labour and product markets?

China is seeking to contain risks in the $43 trillion financial system as slowing growth has helped drive bad debt to levels not seen in 15 years. The government is cracking down on transgressions at small banks, which are the most vulnerable. It has been forced to seize a bank earlier this year and also bailed out others after earlier curbing the massive shadow banking system.

He says 
These large tech companies have ability to charge 10x price to large banks. They sub contract the same work to Fintech start-up at 1/10th of X and make big money üí∞ 

Start-up is hungry for business hence get exploited by these large companies. These large tech companies map the banks so well but leave the solution development sometimes to tech start-up and many times no control at all on what‚Äôs get deployed. 

Some times mobile banking app has an error then customer informs banks ---> Bank informs Large tech ---> large tech informs - Tech start-up...  Its so chaotic 

 Unfortunately Banks dont entertain the tech start-up as they are  unable to fullfill RFP criteria 


How do banks manage this risk???
11/28/19, 10:54 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS COMMUNITY question on recent post of FIS being fined for flouting ATM services norms* CXO 

Many of Bank officials at top are highly paid and not willing to take any risk at all. They are the best banking brains but very very weak on technology. 

They fail to acknowledge that need take ABCD Classes to manage  tech side. 

To hide this weakness they are appointing big consultants to decide on the tech partners. State of  big consultant is no different. They are ppt / reports experts and take help of one the large tech companies and swing the decision in their favour.  And the chain continues.... 

This one reason for so many hacks are happening. Many a times bank top officials have no clue on what‚Äôs going on the tech side.

Time to acknowledge that delivery tool (ie tech) is more important than the subject matter enterprise on banking products.

The legislation is being rolled out over the next two years and it means your card could be declined, despite there being enough funds in your account.

With an estimated 112million contactless cards in the United Kingdom, contactless payment systems such as bank cards or mobile phones now account for one in three payments in the United Kingdom.

"The more important thing that it does is, it allows developers -- internal and external -- to find our APIs, to learn about them, to try them out before they use them in production applications, so when adoption of our APIs goes up, everybody wins," he said.

11/29/19, 09:45 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on eSIM*

*WHAT IS eSIM?*
An eSIM is an electronic SIM card also known as embedded SIM. As the name suggests, it will replace the physical, plastic SIM card

With such an embedded standard, the idea is that you can switch to a new operator without having to insert a specific SIM card. It‚Äôs all done through software.
That is it enables users to change operator remotely, straight from their phone, without having to acquire a new SIM card.

It also allows people to store multiple profiles on a single device, effectively having two or more numbers, and switch between them at ease

eSIM has the ability to use and store multiple profiles. If you travel, for example, getting access to a new country's mobile provider won't require tracking down and swapping out SIM cards.

*QUESTION: Does UPI Support eSIM?*
_Community member says_ 
Esim is just like any other sim except for the part no physical presence on the phone. So when you try to enable the phone to UPI payments, it will work like regular phone.

Plus eSim is actually not so actively used here.. bcoz only 2 telcos give it.. Jio and Airtel.. both only for Postpaid connect...

Currently it‚Äôs less than 1% of total smartphone...

eSim has no impact on UPI. eSim is a physical replacement of a SIM through software on eSim supported handsets. It is a great feature especially for inernational Roaming subscriber. Keep your home country on eSim and buy physical Sim abraod at Airport. Data is very cost effective this way.
11/29/19, 11:17 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Fintech_: *Fintech start-up Robinhood withdraws its application to become a bank*

The application, filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, would have allowed the no-fee stock trading company to offer banking products by itself. Right now, Menlo Park, Calif.-based Robinhood would need to enter into partnerships with other banks to provide services like debit cards. A company spokesman said it has no plans to resubmit its application.

‚ÄúWe are voluntarily withdrawing our OCC application for a national bank charter,‚Äù spokesman Dan Mahoney said in a statement. ‚ÄúRobinhood will continue to focus on increasing participation in the financial system and challenging the industry to better serve everyone.‚Äù

11/29/19, 12:38 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Banking_: *US bank branches have declined rapidly in recent years*

With more personal and small business finance taking place online, in many places the demand for bank branches is in decline. There are 23 counties in the US that have lost more than 50 bank branches since 2010. Cook County, Illinois, which includes the city of Chicago, alone lost over 260 branches. 

Not every place in the US is losing bank branches. Out of the US‚Äôs approximately 3,200 counties, about 9% of them have gained branches since 2010. The majority of these are small counties that gained only one or two branches. They are mostly located in the central US, in areas where there has been an oil and gas boom.

12/2/19, 09:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Facial Recognition_: *China due to introduce face scans for mobile users*

People in China are now required to have their faces scanned when registering new mobile phone services, as the authorities seek to verify the identities of the country's hundreds of millions of internet users. When the regulations were announced in September, the Chinese media did not make a big deal of it.

But online, hundreds of social media users voiced concerns about the increasing amount of data being held on them.

Many others complained that China had already seen too many *data breaches*. "Before, thieves knew what your name was, in the future they'll know what you'll look like," said one user, receiving more than 1,000 likes. Another criticised the policy, saying: "This is being implemented without the consent of the public."

Another said they often received scam calls from people who knew their name and address, and asked: "Will they be able to tell what I look like now?" But others were less cynical, saying that the move was simply in line with "technological progress".

Smart TVs are like regular television sets but with an internet connection. With the advent and growth of Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services, most saw internet-connected televisions as a cord-cutter‚Äôs dream. But like anything that connects to the internet, it opens up smart TVs to security vulnerabilities and hackers. Not only that, many smart TVs come with a camera and a microphone. But as is the case with most other internet-connected devices, manufacturers often don‚Äôt put security as a priority.

That‚Äôs the key takeaway from the FBI‚Äôs Portland field office, which just ahead of some of the biggest shopping days of the year posted a warning on its website about the risks that smart TVs pose.

Why it matters: Companies that help shape standards are able to craft regulations to fit their own goals and specifications. Developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where China has sought to grow its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative, often adopt standards developed by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as policy, according to the FT.

The FT also notes that facial recognition data from African markets is valued by Chinese companies who are seeking to improve their algorithms, especially for people of color.
The Chinese government views shaping standards as a means of furthering its AI leadership ambitions.

With the rise of challenger banks, we‚Äôve seen two different approaches to growth. The first, employed by the largest challengers like N26 and Revolut, is a horizontal approach. These firms target pretty much everyone who‚Äôs comfortable with a digital bank. 
They position themselves as a substitute to customers‚Äô traditional banking relationships by rebundling banking, lending, and investing services. The other path is more niche, catering to a defined demographic7 and providing services attuned to their specific needs. For example, Joust serves self-employed workers and OakNorth attracts entrepreneurs with lumpy cashflow

For years, Google and Facebook have been showing ads based on your online behavior. Retailers from Amazon to Walgreens also regularly suction up your transaction history to steer future spending and hold your loyalty.

Now banks, too, want to turn data they already have on your spending habits into extra revenue by identifying likely customers for retailers. Banks are increasingly aware that they could be sitting on a gold mine of information that can be used to predict ‚Äî or sway ‚Äî where you spend. Historically, such data has been used mostly for fraud protection.

Since the financial crisis in 2008, corporations have splurged on debt amid historically cheap borrowing costs. In recent months, experts have warning that ballooning corporate debt could worsen a future economic downturn.

12/5/19, 09:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Application Development_ : *Why are software development houses switching to no-code?*

A no-code platform requires no knowledge of coding from a developer. Instead of requiring traditional programming language skills, no-code platforms enable a developer to build via what is known as visual modelling. You define the logic of your application, then select components for the build (‚Äúblocks‚Äù) from a library, dragging and dropping them into an on-screen workflow. No-code platforms also allow for the smooth integration of newly built applications ‚Äì existing web services and application programming interfaces (APIs) ‚Äì into an organisation‚Äôs enterprise resource planning (ERP) architecture.

No-code platforms for application development offer the advantages of speed and ease of use, and help firms escape developer skills shortages.

Although no one is saying that coding is dead or that programmers are going to be out of a job soon, there is no denying that the current demand for software far exceeds the supply of coders and that many traditional ways of building applications are complex and time-consuming.

He says most of the bank preferred banking services claim that their product is suppose to provide clients with a *complete digital and paper free experience*. So

*Q1* why waste money spending millions of dollar on doing interior designing of the branch which customer will never visit. When did you visit the bank branch last? Why not partner with 5-star hotel and meet them there over coffee. That will be cheaper.. Right ?

*Q2* why do you need dedicated manager who will work only 10 to 6. Instead a dedicated call centre support 24x7 would be more cost effective. Isn‚Äôt it? 

*Q3* Do you think these banks will ever be able to compete with fintech/ Neo banks? Will bureaucratic set-up within these banks will ever allow them to think beyond *Sofas*

12/5/19, 10:27 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community on PREFERRED BANKING SOFA*

*_VIEW 7 ( former CXO BANKER & Fintech Founder)_*

I think, these preferred lounges are for HNW individuals. They like to have a confidential space where investments can be discussed safely. A public coffee house or a co-working space won't do

Plus, banks use this space to do many events - art evenings, wine tasting, market views etc. So a dedicated space helps

Most Private banking RMs are never 10-6. They are available round the clock

So, while the infra is expensive, I think a small investment helps to differentiate them from the other banks & fintechs


*_View 11-  CXO MNC banker_*

My views...

I would encourage people to visit a bank branch to know how many people actually visit a branch... Just because you don't doesn't mean the world doesn't...

Dedicated Manager is in addition to 24√ó7 Call center and is available most of the time, not only 10-6 (atleast the good ones)... By contrast, try calling a fintech/ neobank...

As far as being able to compete, I think each has a space... It's about Knowing who is your customer, and why are you relevant to them... Choose your customer segments correctly and serve them well...
12/5/19, 10:52 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community CXO fintech shared Anonymous on PREFERRED BANKING Sofa*

Bankers are giving thumps up  to sofa means lack of understanding of digital. They talk digital in conferences..pitch digital & paperless in brochures/website but don't understand millennial nor will acknowledge ever 

Best privacy is in hotels ü§£ and bankers too know that. But mind set  is still old age banking. They will not understand disruption until regulatory comfort is removed. Banks that are declared as too big to fail by regulators  are unable to manage Internet banking and mobile banking. 
Trust in banking is only because banks are not allowed to fail.

*RBI issues circular : Statement on Development and Regulatory Policies*

Key points to consider:

7. Review of NBFC-P2P Directions- Aggregate Lender Limit and escrow accounts
The Reserve Bank had issued directions for Non-Banking Financial Company-Peer to Peer 
Lending platform (NBFC-P2P) on October 4, 2017. At present, the aggregate limits for both 
borrowers and lenders across all P2P platforms stand at ‚Çπ10 lakh, whereas exposure of a 
single lender to a single borrower is capped at ‚Çπ50,000 across all NBFC-P2P platforms. A 
review of the functioning of the lending platforms and lending limit was carried out and it has 
been decided that in order to give the next push to the lending platforms, the aggregate 
exposure of a lender to all borrowers at any point of time, across all P2P platforms, shall be 
subject to a cap of ‚Çπ50 lakh. Further, it is also proposed to do away with the current 
requirement of escrow accounts to be operated by bank promoted trustee for transfer of funds 
having to be necessarily opened with the concerned bank. This will help provide more 
flexibility in operations. Necessary instructions in this regard will be issued shortly.


10. New Pre-Paid Payment Instruments (PPI)
Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) have been playing an important role in promoting digital 
payments. To further facilitate its usage, it is proposed to introduce a new type of PPI which 
can be used only for purchase of goods and services up to a limit of ‚Çπ10,000. The loading / 
reloading of such PPI will be only from a bank account and used for making only digital 
payments such as bill payments, merchant payments, etc. Such PPIs can be issued on the basis 
of essential minimum details sourced from the customer. Instructions in this regard will be 
issued by December 31, 2019.

For businesses today, cyber risk is everywhere. Yet for all the investments they‚Äôve made to secure their systems and protect customers, companies are still struggling to make cybersecurity a vibrant, proactive part of strategy, operations, and culture. The root cause is twofold: (1) Cybersecurity is treated as a back-office job and (2) most cyber leaders are ill-equipped to exert strategic influence. Given that a cyber leader‚Äôs average tenure is just 18 months, it‚Äôs clear that something needs to change.

It remains one of the least digitally transformed sectors of the economy. The report addresses the following questions-¬†
 1) *How can technological disruption in the white space of infrastructure be encouraged?* 
2) *How does the public sector drive innovation in technology by creating frameworks that encourage exchange while protecting intellectual property?*

 He says  improving on this, one can always set 'known vpa' for collect request.

I.e. if i know 3-4 vpa where i regularly transact or intend to transact, only those vpa can send collect request.

Rest of all vpa collect request shall be put in a low priority  queue. (Similar to email junk folder).

Added safety measures like a one time hash value for ' intending to pay' is sent to the collector .

The hash needs to be sent back to the payer along with public key of collector who shall verify the hash with the payer private key and on successful validation collect request shall be processed.

This is will prevent man in the middle or masqueraded transactions.

Any key validation violations.Shall be flagged off to the psp

12/6/19, 10:54 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Maven challenges "Known VPA" recommendations  to Regulator  to avoid UPI FRAUDS*  CXO BANKER

He says .

Would the fraud then not just move one level away? The fraudster would start by social engineering the ‚Äòknown vpa‚Äô leg. This suggestion is similar to the current process of account registration before you send a payment through neft/ rtgs. It will reduce fraud to some extent but create friction in the system.

As I see it, the *main reason fraud happens is because customer is not able to differentiate between a collect message and a pay message*. How to differentiate these two categories of message, to enable a neophyte to understand, is the need of the hour

A parliamentary committee called for changes in October following a string of IT failures at banks, most recently one at TSB that left thousands of customers unable to make payments from their accounts.

The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have proposed that banks, insurers, investment firms, exchanges and financial market infrastructure (FMIs) firms like Visa that make payments possible, set ‚Äúimpact tolerances‚Äù for important services.

12/6/19, 15:31 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Can't they declare bankruptcy ? Anyhow, users will port one of the remaining service providers
12/6/19, 15:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The amount of write-off will be too big.
12/6/19, 15:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For anyone of them to do it.
12/6/19, 15:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But it‚Äôs a great game play.
It‚Äôs a bluff that can‚Äôt be called by the market or the government.
The govt will give relief.
12/6/19, 15:36 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: If they declare bankruptcy lots of PSU banks will have an issue. And eventually govt will have to re monetise them. 
Which will be tax payers money. 
Hence it‚Äôs better for govt to come up with some relief. Relief can be simple that the AGR payments can be done over day 24 months etc

_We will carry couple of responses shared by the members  across community and rest will be covered as a part of FIAKS bespoke Reports_
www.fiaks.com/fiaks-bespoke
12/9/19, 11:41 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on Account number & name match basic feature*  

*View 4* CXO Fintech 

Yes. It is the basic feature that is needed for many activities beyond transactions...

 Danger of misapplied funds is very real...

Also, in a KYC obsessed banking regulatory regime... Mergers leave the banks with a huge and erroneous de-duplication effort where diverse practices of legacy data   have resulted in a offline keying in off unique identifiers... Half a century of automated banking is yet to resolve the issues and arrive at a right algorithm to prevent erroneous credits... Debits, however, get reported anyway
12/9/19, 11:47 - +91 90233 89243: One of my patents was around this as well
12/9/19, 11:49 - +91 90233 89243: Equally surprised as I never saw this even after UPI lauch. This is a basic need when we do ifsc and acc transfer.
12/9/19, 11:57 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on Account number & name match basic feature*

*View 6* Founder of bank 

Character matching is not really a challenge from IT perspective.  But given how names are written the percentage of failed matches would soar.  After all the 12 digit account no is typed twice to eliminate error.

*Question here is*

Here we are talking about a *customer X* visit a *bank A* and gives a cheque of Rs 1000 to be deposited in *customer account Y*  (1235) which is with *bank B* 

If he mentions wrong account  number as 1234 on the cheque... *Banks A* are today unable to verify name and account number of *customer B* 

Funds gets transferred in *customer account U* with bank B

*View 10 - Raises concerns on UPI*


Equally surprised as I never saw this even after UPI launchüò±. This is a basic need when we do IFSC and account  transfer.
12/9/19, 12:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Simple thing to do is 
Exact Account Match.
Percentage Name Match (rather than exact match).
12/9/19, 12:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nobody is asking for to check if it‚Äôs 
Raghuram Sadashiv Tirupati Sundaram
Vs
Raghu Sadashiv Tirupati
12/9/19, 12:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If account number matches, which should be an exact match, a percentage match on name will suffice.
12/9/19, 12:10 - Vikas Business Phone: Check the example given in the above post
12/9/19, 12:10 - Vikas Business Phone: How do we address that
12/9/19, 12:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The chequer shouldn‚Äôt go through if account number is wrong.
12/9/19, 12:12 - Vikas Business Phone: Yes but such checks are not available
12/9/19, 12:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If X% name doesn‚Äôt match for the account number it shouldn‚Äôt go through.

There should be a way to check name of Customer B via some kind of an interface or Bank A should key in customer name B which can be checked and reverted.
12/9/19, 12:17 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Transfer Should be Account Number based with Partial Match on the name.
Like *John Doe* ~ *Jon Doe*
If the account number is wrong then the onus is on the customer
12/9/19, 12:22 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: This might sound crazy -just don't ask for the name. The presence of the name gives a false assurance to the sender that there is some value to the name when none exists. Not asking for it will ensure that the sender gives the due importance to the number.  95% success with any form of fuzzy name matching is too poor and I don't see it becoming better in the near future, mostly due to how users act.
12/9/19, 12:24 - +91 90233 89243: Nope, but as a user you transfer to a name before an account
12/9/19, 12:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is a good idea but the world will need a second factor authentication simply because such a theory will never be able to take flight otherwise. Had this been done from the beginning (which it should have since Name has no bearing what so ever so don‚Äôt even know why it is being done).
12/9/19, 12:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Fair point from UX pov @919845001571
12/9/19, 12:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: May be phone number match?
12/9/19, 12:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Since phone number are Key IDs, it might help. And you generally don‚Äôt transfer someone money whose number you don‚Äôt know.
12/9/19, 12:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the added layer beyond name can be phone number.
12/9/19, 12:29 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Like when you get a new email id or number - you use that before you associate a name with that. A name is what *you* call it in your address book and not what the other person calls themselves. So a name is a "nickname" that you give on your side and not necessarily the name of the account holder.
12/9/19, 12:29 - +91 90233 89243: Thats changing the existing ifsc and acc number transfer from a process per se,  however that can be an option.
12/9/19, 12:30 - +91 90233 89243: apologies, i wud not use this analogy while doing a bank transfer to be honest.
12/9/19, 12:33 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: All these issues can be solved if Open Banking or API banking network is set. Using a Simple API the Name and Account number can be verified just like in UPI.
12/9/19, 12:34 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: What would be interesting is if the recipient could share a QR code of the details - proper name, IFSC etc and the sender scans it to register the recipient account rather than type it in manually as it works today. You can eliminate mistakes that way. And it doesn't need any changes to any existing systems other than the front-end tools (website, app). This is exactly how UPI or QR code payments eliminate the problem of typing in the merchant IDs and it works at scale.
12/9/19, 12:35 - Vikas Business Phone: If i am using net banking of bank and enter correct name but wrong account number of a customer in another bank B then money *should not* get transferred 

Name and account number match is must feature
12/9/19, 12:38 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Maybe a 'Share my details" facility in the recipients app could generate a record (like the .vcf used for contacts) and send a structured info to the other party who could import it.
12/9/19, 12:39 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Same like sharing QR Code for UPI
12/9/19, 12:40 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: But problem will be in desktop application. Importing a XML or CSV in browser may be a security issue
12/9/19, 12:41 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: That's easy to resolve. Signed content is robust enough.
12/9/19, 12:45 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I personally wouldn't want any bank to transfer money (or decline to transfer) by applying "close enough names" judgement. Exact matches are too unreliable because names are inherently cultural things and not intended for such machine comparisons.
12/9/19, 12:48 - Vikas Business Phone: Great responses... Will cover in bespoke reports
12/9/19, 12:49 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I think it's high time to think something like UPI for Desktop
12/9/19, 12:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Shouldn‚Äôt the person transferring money know the cultural nuances of the people and therefore the names that he/she is transferring to?
12/9/19, 12:51 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Only thing will not be possible is SIM and Mobile Device Authentication. But that can be easily solved using Browser Device Fingerprinting and OTP
12/9/19, 12:55 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I think the core of what I am saying is that financial systems should behave absolutely predictably. There should be nothing in the path where a heuristic based decision is taken. 98% or 99% confidence levels in such decisions are still unacceptable. Hence the tokens of identity should lend themselves to exact matches, which for practical purposes makes names very unsuitable.
12/9/19, 12:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Makes sense.
12/9/19, 12:56 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Think of when you pay electricity meters or pay your STB subsciptions - you pay against a numeric identity and not for "ABC's electricity meter". People understand that distinction.
12/9/19, 12:58 - +91 90233 89243: I might be too user focused here, but if you look from a common user , you still pay to your electricity board and not to any numeric identity, right?
12/9/19, 13:00 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: In practice you will use some app or service where the primary input you provide is your number. You rarely know the account number of the utility company. You are in some sense paying into your "meter account" at "utility bank" since you don't really know the details of the utility company itself.
12/9/19, 13:02 - +91 90233 89243: completely agree, but at that time you have your paper bill or any other form that can validate your entry and make sure that you are not paying to anyone else. In bank transfer thats still like TBD
12/9/19, 13:03 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Even when I am deposit cash on SBI through CDM or Green Channel, I type in the Account number only. The Bank provides a confirmation of the A/C holder name for verification, and transaction takes place. No account name is input here.
12/9/19, 13:11 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community members on Account number & name match basic feature*

*View 17*. Cxo banker 

name and number match is very difficult to achieve. once i had suggested to Regulator that put account number, API fetches name and display, sender confirms and then money goes..no need to even enter account number twice (As name visual siting provides 2nd level)

*Views 26* Cxo banker 
That will have huge privacy and security issues as the API will have to access the core banking of the other bank that fetch the name.

*View 30* Cxo banker 
imps is doing that - in 30 seconds, the name comes back as an SMS. several Fin services are using this to verify name on the bank account for loan purposes
12/9/19, 13:17 - +91 90233 89243: Just wondering , Only fteching name(though its a PII data) cant be a huge privacy issue, isnt it? Yes its a potential risk though.

China's monetary policy is already quite loose, and attempting to stimulate the economy to grow faster than its potential could cause it to fall off a cliff, said Liu.

Unlike decades of war and terrorism to which Israel has been subjected, and which most Israelis do military service to defend the country against, in this case it‚Äôs the same Israelis who are opening the door to this takeover.

 *Nine big shifts that will determine your future Business of Technology*

The pace & scope of Digital Disruption in the modern world is not slowing down. If anything, developing technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT),  robotics and virtual reality mean that businesses will be confronted with successive waves of new digital technologies. The consequent disruptions to industries will be difficult to predict, let alone influence. Many companies need to design a Business of Technology that is fully capable of dealing with both the threats as well as the opportunities that emerge. However, in organisations that recognise this need for digital transformation, a jarring mismatch between their emerging digital strategy and their existing ‚Äì traditional ‚Äì IT operating model is observed.

All nine big shifts have an impact that transcends the IT organisation. They impact the business operating model of the enterprise itself and hence, not only impact the CIO, but also the CEO, CFO, COO and Lines of Business Directors.

*View 5* CXO Payment professional

Its very simple, news papers and customers are not reporting the entire facts, nothing can be derived from partial and sensational stories. Else we  all know by now, the familiar route of "download an app" " click on a link" and gullible customers filling all details. Bottomline, till date all scams have been phishing requests to make the customer reveal the banking details.

*Industry evangelist on FIAKS platform shares an extract from recent article on ‚ÄúQR CODE SCAM‚Äù*

*How does this scam work?*

Basically, it does the same as when you would enter your login credentials on a banking phish site. The scammers used social engineering to con victims into allowing them to scan the QR code on their own phone. By doing so, the victims provided the scammers with the login credentials to their banking environment.

With those in hand, it‚Äôs easy for the threat actors to make some payments on your behalf‚Äîinto accounts under their control, obviously. It is likely that they used money mules to convert those payments into cash they could then spend freely without raising suspicion.

*Other QR scams*

Besides the fake banking environment scam, there have been reports of QR codes that were rigged to download malware onto the victim‚Äôs device. Also, criminals have been known to replace public and unguarded QR codes with their own so that payments would flow into their pockets.

For example, in China where bike-sharing is immensely popular and you pay in advance to unlock the bike, it can be profitable for criminals to replace the QR codes on a large number of bikes with some of their own. This could bring in a lot of (small) payments into the threat actor‚Äôs account, and many potential bike renters would shrug it off when the bike fails to unlock and move on to the next one to try their luck.

To back up a little bit, cookies are pieces of information saved about you when you‚Äôre online, and they track you as you browse. So say you go to a weather website and put in your zip code to look up what‚Äôs happening in your area; the next time you visit the same site, it will remember your zip code because of cookies. There are first-party cookies that are placed by the site you visit, and then there are third-party cookies, such as those placed by advertisers to see what you‚Äôre interested in and in turn serve you ads ‚Äî even when you leave the original site you visited. (This is how ads follow you around the internet.)

The proliferation of such alerts was largely triggered by two different regulations in Europe: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping data privacy law enacted in the European Union in May 2018; and the ePrivacy Directive, which was first passed in 2002 and then updated in 2009. They, and the cookie alerts that resulted, have plenty of good intentions. But they‚Äôre ineffectual.

12/12/19, 09:57 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts raised major concern On OPEN BANKING* 

*View 4*
One of the main challenges facing open banking is *security*. The majority of companies that are championing open banking are small FinTech companies, not tech giants like Apple and Google, and a lack of homogenous technical standards, such as certain security requirements, combined with complex internal technology systems may make the process susceptible to corruption and fraudulent activity

Another concern about open banking is liability, as inserting *third-party providers* into the banking process *increases the risk of scammers gaining access to customer information and their finances*. Under open banking, consumers should have any losses replenished by their bank unless there is reason to suspect fraud or negligence, but with both banks and FinTechs alike facing increased security threats, without proper legal clarification it‚Äôs inevitable that providers will try and blame a third party.
12/12/19, 10:22 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts CXO banker shared anonymously on OPEN BANKING CONCERNS*

*Views 17*

 Imagine a customer who banks with a financial institution that has an open banking relationship with a *third party offering* other services. As a result, the third party has access to some customer details. If the third party experiences a breach, the customer‚Äôs details could become available to *criminal organizations*.

That possibility illustrates some of the biggest concerns with open banking: *privacy breaches, data security, cybercrime and fraud*. The financial services industry is already a significant target of fraud and hacking attempts.

Open banking has the potential to magnify the impact of breach and cybersecurity incidents when they happen, which could mean reputational risk and erosion of customer trust for the banks


*Question* Can leadership team of bank  be made accountable for blunders that happen on account of beaches due to open banking.

Decisions makers walking away by  saying nothing is  100% safe and putting customer at risk is just *NOT* acceptable.
12/12/19, 10:37 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community thought leader on Open Banking Concerns*

*View 24*

He says 

Isn‚Äôt it a convulated logic. It‚Äôs continuum of the same approach all Bankers take when challenged with innovation - hide behind regulator / regulation and say ‚Äúsave poor me‚Äù.

To begin with this data was acquired by banks under regulator‚Äôs protection - both on access to market (licensing based on fit and proper) which led to PSU banks, then institutional banks and then private banks and still market is protected from global competition. Indian banks don‚Äôt have to compete against Japanese or European or American or Chinese banks with such large balance sheets because of protection else they would have got wiped out like our TV or computer or even Some agri products. 

Banks have constantly been bailed out by regulator / govt despite protective pricing (saving interest cap) preferefered access to Business  (govt float, forex flows). With the increasing gaps emerging in governance all formats - PSU, institutional, private seem to be under doubt. 

With that background to expect regulator to rely on  the same set of institutions seems counter intuitive. 

It‚Äôs customer data. If benefit can be passed to customer by models developed by non banks than banks, then why not?

If shereholders of banks and management of banks want to protect their investment by putting pressure on regulator, they should let the same regulator let them fail in case of  their gaps / business calls. 

 Many fintech are also investing in customer data. They are building excellent business models not because they are banks. They are a better bet for working on customer data than incumbents.

 *Executing the open banking strategy in the United States*

WE ARE RACING toward a future dominated by an open-data economy. Until recently, customer data was zealously kept within the narrow confines of individual organizations. Now, data is quickly becoming more ‚Äúopen‚Äù and shared with external parties. Even more important, a fundamental shift is now underway over who has control of this data: It is being returned to the customers who generated it.

While open banking is in the early stages of its evolution, many expect this trend to accelerate and reshape the banking industry in meaningful ways.

12/13/19, 14:05 - Vikas Business Phone: *The Union Cabinet has approved overhaul of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2019.* Important point to be known About it 


*Point 1*. The latest changes to the IBC ring-fence the successful bidders of stressed assets from the risk of criminal proceedings against offences committed by previous management and promoters, according to an official statement. 

*Point 2* . In other words, successful bidders will be provided more immunity against any risk of criminal proceedings for offences committed by previous promoters of companies concerned. 

*Point 3*. The bill also proposes a threshold for financial creditors to prevent frivolous triggering of corporate insolvency. In other words, this will ensure that bankruptcy is not invoked for small amounts. 

*Point 4*. The amendments are aimed at providing more protection to bidders participating in the recovery proceedings and in turn boosting investor confidence in the country's financial system.

*Point 5* The provisions allow the corporate debtors to continue as a going concern by clarifying that the licenses, permits, concessions and clearances cannot be terminated or suspended during the moratorium period.

*Point 6* "Approval by the cabinet to provide immunity to successful bidders under IBC is a great boost to IBC," said Sapan Gupta, partner and national head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas."This is a positive and timely step and will increase confidence among prospective buyers of stressed assets."

*point 7*. The government has in the past few months announced a series of steps to restore the health of the country's financial sector to achieve its goal of making India a $5-trillion economy. The country's economy expanded 5 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, marking the lowest pace of growth in more than six years. 

*Point 8* . In a separate development, the cabinet approved Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme for purchase of high-rated pooled assets from financially sound non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) - also known as shadow banks - by state-run banks.

*Point 9* Easier lending rules are aimed at enabling NBFCs to get better access to funds. NBFCs have been key drivers of lending growth in India, with their consolidated balance sheet worth Rs 28.8 lakh crore ($400 billion) in 2018-19, according to RBI data. 

*Point 10* The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code replaces laws such as the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA Act) and the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act (SARFAESI Act), shifting the control of recovery process to creditors from borrowers.

He says we Busted one card cloning gang in Azamgarh today . They purchased Skimming devices( card reader, Card writer ) , blank plastic cards from Alibaba to bypass OTP from a cloned card itself . Delivery addresses were slightly different from original one and Mobile numbers given on delivery addresses were issued on fake KYC . Distributed skimmers to dealing operators on petrol pumps , hotels, and CSCs ( Where Micro ATM / ePOS devises were being used) to  skim card and note down PIN or even installed Spy camera to record PIN .. 
*Modus operandi is just as simple and tutorials are available on YouTube*.. These arrested  4 guys confessed to be trained by a Jamtara guy  ( Jharkhand Based ) in Mumbai .. they admitted that their gang members are active in Mumbai , Delhi , Gujarat and UP ...
only in Azamgarh, they withdrew about 10 lakhs from cloned cards .. Leaving Pan-  India figures to guess on to you friends ..

He says 
*I don't think it is cloning of chip*. The cloning is only of Magstripe in my understanding. Clarify from the member. Even if the POS is still using Magstripe (which it too should be disallowed) & cloning takes place from EMV card to create a Magstripe card, the ATMs used for cash withdrawal should not be allowing it.
12/16/19, 10:29 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Maven on USE OF EMV? He says its a myth that emv cards cannot be cloned*

ATMs are not fully emv compliant yet, plus the use of emv is to cut down on cloning, the card itself doesnt prevent cloning from the magstripe, its the reading of the chip by accepting devices, which cuts risk of cloned cards, its a myth that emv cards cannot be cloned, its a truth that reading of the chip rather than magstripe is wat prevents cloning and its a ugly truth that most ATMs are still not compliant.

*Are banks/regulatory authority/ card associations aware about such risk related to EMV? How can they put customers at risk which such security feature or will they again say nothing is 100% safe*ü§î

Now, instead of a Chrome extension, Password Checkup is being integrated into the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome 79.

CEIR acts as a central system for all network Operators to share black listed mobile devices so that devices blacklisted in one network will not work on other networks even if the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card in the device is changed.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:

‚ñ™Front- and middle-office AI applications offer the greatest cost savings opportunity across banks.
‚ñ™Banks are leveraging AI on the front end to smooth customer identification and authentication, mimic live employees through chatbots and voice assistants, deepen customer relationships, and provide personalized insights and recommendations.
‚ñ™AI is also being implemented by banks within middle-office functions to detect and prevent payments fraud and to improve processes for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulatory checks.
‚ñ™The winning strategies employed by banks that are undergoing an AI-enabled transformation reveal how to best capture the opportunity. These strategies highlight the need for a holistic AI strategy that extends across banks' business lines, usable data, partnerships with external partners, and qualified employees.

ease of use... upi transfers can be done with a couple of clicks from most apps, no need for payee setup and account details.. neft will require a little more effort to setup and transact.

*View 2*

Circular posted above says NEFT is free while UPI banks are changing fee. Customer will be willing to take extra efforts 

*View 5*

UPI & IMPS  transaction will see down fall in coming months. More impact on IMPS

*View 7*
The convenience of UPI doesn't lie in all this but in the simplicity of vpa handle. As long as that usp stays, UPI rocks...

*View 9*
I don't think that's how it's played out, UPI is getting used more for micro payments (evident from the significantly lower average ticket size). Secondly there hasn't been a drop in NEFT volumes since the launch of UPI. ~25% of UPI payments are used for merchant payments. Imagine having to pay a physical merchant by typing in the IFSC code, account no. Etc

Stablecoins promise to make transacting value as easy as using social media, integrating into our digital lives in ways that fiat currency, issued by central banks, cannot hope to.

*View 23* _Advisor PSU bank and former Chief General Manager says_


There are a number of criteria for identifying NPAs which are subjective in nature. For example, as per RBI guidelines, accounts showing "intrinsic weakness" should be deemed as NPAs..
Quite often, it's easier for RBI inspectors to flag an account as intrinsically weak because they come after the balance sheet date, when the weaknesses are more evident than it was when the balance sheet was prepared by the Bank a few months ago.
Normally, no bank management would classify an "intrinsically weak" account as NPA, if the recovery record is in order when the balance sheet is prepared.
The same account may be having overdues of over 90 days when the RBI inspectors walk in to check the books after few months.
This is a common cause for divergences.

12/19/19, 01:21 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: Income tax department over the years deployed a technology intensive monitoring system to identify potential tax defaults. Can RBI come up with a system that dives into every bank‚Äôs CBS and finds certain standardised metrics akin to XBRL tags and derive the true NPAs of every bank? Is this a situation of the central bank relying more on the individual banks‚Äô reporting mechanism which is obviously incentivised to hide the NPAs and less on technology that can bring uniform numbers to the fore more efficiently?

*View 26* CXO fintech, 

Instant payments do enable easy access to funds by a depositor... However, a bank that has started thinking that retention of a customer and funds is a function of  restriction of access, has already set itself on a path to extinction... It does not need a disruption or innovation to enable it...

12/19/19, 14:36 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member shares pathetic DIGITAL PAYMENT experience. He says shouldn‚Äôt RBI question banks sponsoring such payment program or the payment company itself. He narrates the entire experience* 

we faced a lots of issues at the V2 concert( name changed). Organisation was pits to say the least.
We were provided an card which was to be sole method to transact at the concert venue. It was a *Payment Company( Name not disclosed) prepaid card*. We were told that we could preload the card before visiting the venue. I tried whole day Sunday to do so but the  *P2 app* just did not recognise the card!

At the venue there were huge queues to activate the card. We were supposed to tab it on a kiosk. The queue were huge because the kiosks were not functioning as planned. Had to stand in 3 different queues before I could activate. Got a green ‚úÖ and the screen showed balance of ‚Çπ0.

After that I loaded ‚Çπ1,000 for which they charged ‚Çπ118!! Anyway after that I tired using the card across various establishments and the card did not work!! I was asked to speak to *P2* and *P1* reps at the venue which I did. They gave a ‚Äúpreauthorised‚Äù card which I recharged by paying cash, for which there was no additional charge!! So strange!! Both promised to refund the money!! I am yet to see the money!!

This is just the tip of the issues. Here are a few others, which are largely related to bad organisation:

1. We were to buy bottomless cups for water. The water ran out in the stands! And guess what they were selling bottles for ‚Çπ50 each!! Quite clearly a conflict!!

2. Food ran out too! Wonder what we were supposed to use the balance on the card! There was no break. So if one were to go down, to buy either water or food, one would have to miss at least 15-20 minutes of the concert!! Queues were long on the ground as the food stalls in the stands were dysfunctional!!

3. Worst was their inability to manage vehicle flow! It took some people more than 90 minutes to get into their cars!!

All in all a frustrating digital experience

Here are some of the key takeaways of this report: 

‚ñ™The "buy now, pay later" model lends itself to the instant gratification that people ‚Äî particularly younger consumers ‚Äî want. So, younger consumers have become the primary audience for many of these services, driving much of their volume. 
‚ñ™POS financing offerings are largely being used as alternatives to credit cards, particularly by younger consumers: 52% of Gen Zers and 60% of millennials say they're interested in payment methods other than traditional credit cards to finance large e-commerce purchases.
‚ñ™Going forward, these consumers will propel the payment option's popularity, largely because of this hesitance to adopt credit cards. And POS financing fintechs have gained traction by removing consumers' specific credit pain points: They've tackled consumers' confusion over how the annual percentage rate (APR) works, for example, by offering transparent loan terms. There are certain strategies legacy providers can implement to reach this customer segment and combat those fintechs.

12/23/19, 11:21 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Open Banking_: *Open banking reforms delayed as security tests drag on*

The consumer watchdog will spend more time ensuring a new financial data-sharing regime is resilient against cyber security threats, after technical hiccups delayed the launch of open banking by six months.

The change will hold back the plans of neobanks keen to entice big bank customers who are willing to share their data, but the ACCC said the rollout had proven more complex than it had expected and that trust in the system was vital.

Open banking is a policy that will allow bank customers to securely share financial data about them held by the bank with a competitor, such as a fintech firm.

ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said that after various technical defects were detected, it would not have been responsible to roll out open banking in February, which had always been a tight time frame.

Why shouldn‚Äôt bank use various data points including religion of the customer as part of *KYC scoring process*. 

For eg if bank has suffered 100 frauds so far.  Distribution of frauds on the basis religion is suppose as under: 

5% frauds religion X
45% Frauds religion Y 
55% Frauds religion Z 

Next time person of Religion Z applies for a loan he/she gets lesser score on KYC. What‚Äôs wrong here in having religion  build in the scoring algorithm ? 

He adds by saying from *privacy perspective* my date of birth, my mobile number, my Income level, my email ID Etc is more confidential. Isn‚Äôt it ? And I am sharing all this during Account Opening 

Also what‚Äôs wrong if my Relationship manager of bank  wants to invite me or wish on Christmas or on Diwali ? Or sends me an invite to some function basis my religion?

As a bank policy the religion based discrimination is not available. Yes it‚Äôs obvious that certain section ( religion ) would be high on the fraudualent cases . But the scoring can be done basis the name , address and any common repository or database which can be available or updated by the bankers with the repeated cases . In a way these shouldn‚Äôt be disclosed in public but as a cross check it can be done

12/23/19, 17:12 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: If a single bank does it, then it is really not of much concern. Presumably they have some means of using this info for better decisions somewhere, and more importantly, there are other banks which may not. A central bank mandate makes it rather questionable. Religion in India has similar connotations in India as race does in the US and while they started late, they have been working on it more openly and the laws governing where info on a person's race can be asked are much more .... progressive (for lack of a better word). There has been enough research done which show that even in the absence of explicit race info, race inferred from names has proven to bias employers and many organizations are now trying to do nameless filtering of job applications. In the light of such things, this mandate seems regressive.

He says 

Religion as part of account data is highly objectionable. The thought process itself is highly flawed. This is pure and simple attempt to introduce discrimination on the basis of religious identity. Those who are talking analysing frauds on the basis of religious identity are following a very flawed logic, a racist ideology. This is also a case of inductive fallacy - deriving universal or generalised conclusions on the basis of singular or particular instances. How can statistical correlation be drawn between two variables as religious identity & frauds? It is like mumbo jumbo scientism: every time the group /tribe carries out a ritual dance there is plentiful rain /harvest etc. Correlation is not causation. Banking cannot be ideology driven. Racism and bigotry must not be allowed in mass banking.

Firstly we should  accept that religion is an integral part of most Indians' lives.  It is on your face everyday right from the morning Aartis, aazan calls, good morning greetings in WhatsApp and even Bhajan groups in local trains .  So to hide behind Western standards of propriety and exclude this critical data point from Bank records is foolish. Like any non core data  the individual concerned should have the option not to provide the data if he so chooses,  but *Banks asking for it per se should not be frowned upon*.  In West a vast majority of people consider themselves as non religious  but in India hardly 1% will fall in this group. Discrimination basis religion can happen even if I don't provide it explicitly , in most cases it will be self evident from the name itself! At an aggregate level this data can be valuable.  Like how many Jan Dhan accounts are there for a community and what balances they enjoy and their saving and spend habits.  It can help the bank decide at what time bank should pitch for a personal loan  to a customer - for Diwali or ramadan; Should we offer interest bearing products or profit sharing products etc.  Of course there has to be strict rules to ensure the information is not used to discriminate or favour any Group,  *but the idea that we can prevent discrimination by suppressing information is flawed.*

I was having 262 as balance when I started from Kharghar towards Lonavala on Saturday morning. 173 got deducted from khalapur toll gate. There is *no clear guidance* for the traveller to chose the fastag lane. The process is slower than the cash process, *operator was not ready with the scanner*. It is slower inspite of the fact that the operator will provide change also in case of cash.

I received the sms after I reached Lonavala i.e., *almost 20 minutes*. Balance as per sms is 89, which is fine.

While returning, I have taken the Khopoli route, visited Karjat and then taken NH to reach the Highway once again. At NH the operator used the scanner and it has shown success and the operator allowed me to proceed further. There is one more toll gate to reach the expressway from highway, where the *scanner was showing the error that the tag is invalid after multiple times*. Paid cash to proceed further.

After reaching home when I checked the balance, system was showing the balance as 89, meaning, it has not deducted the money at my first toll gate . This will be a loss for operator.

I feel that Government/NPCI has to workout on the issues which includes delay in delivery of sms before making it mandatory. Already i can see lot of confusion with the operator as well as the traveller. *Instead of reducing fuel usage it increases the fuel and blood pressure.*
12/24/19, 13:35 - +91 90233 89243: Sms not reaching on time is an issue for sure, It happened to me multiple times not with fastag but with other functions like aadhar appointment online booking, mutual funds etc.

Both the users and the toll staff should get used to it....it's a matter of time, good initiative by the govt, of course banks will get huge float of residual balance lying in the fastag account...

12/26/19, 09:17 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Chip and PIN is better, but flawed_ *Why your debit card is the least secure way to pay for goods*


According to Chan-Tin, using chip and PIN credit and debit cards are more secure than standard cards, but still suffer from the same issues as their less secure stablemates. That's because chip and PIN cards still have the same magstripes on them that are so easy to swipe your data from.

When used at a compatible point-of-sale terminal, chip and PIN cards use encryption to lock down the information sent back and forth between the terminal and the payment processing center.

He says

 That's why the risk is handled using liability shift. In a payment cycle whoever does not have EMV capability, (acquirer or issuer), bears the liability, if there is a charge back

Many banks have resorted to stopping magstripe transactions even as fallback, apprehending liability shift, if transaction is fraudulent.

In India, the liability shift has already started as the deadline for ATM acquiring was already over. Hence many issuing banks do not allow magstripe transaction for their customers (as fall back) apprehending liability shift. ATM EMV acquiring

- these types of ‚Äúwallets‚Äù will most likely be used for instant account opening and move ‚Äúactive‚Äù users to full kyc status or for refunds and cashbacks
- Didnt understand why reloading by cards isnt allowed. I am assuming though banks means debit card including. Since funds transfer isnt allowed and wallet limit is 10K, dont think fraud shud b a primary concern

A former French CEO, 
the answer to today's quiz is:
*Didier Lombard*
Former CEO of *Orange*

Orange is a large dominant global company with 266 million customers, roughly 150 thousand employees and a top-ten mobile network operator. The company, once run by the government, was privatized. This transaction incurred significant costs. The now private company could no longer rely on the largess of the government. To cut costs, executives hatched a plan to get rid of about 22,000 workers as part of an overall restructuring.

Former CEO Didier Lombard, was accused of masterminding the devious plot to jettison workers ‚Äúeither through the window or through the door.‚Äù He was sentenced to four months in jail along with a $16,000 fine. Two other top executives including Orange‚Äôs then-director of human resources received jail time and fines. Orange was fined around $83,000.

12/30/19, 09:13 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Artificial intelligence_ *AI is helping us talk to animals*

AI has helped us decode ancient languages, and now researchers are turning the same technique to help understand our pets

Our AI-enhanced abilities to decode languages have reached a point where they could start to parse languages not spoken by anyone alive. Recently, researchers from MIT and Google applied these abilities to ancient scripts ‚Äì Linear B and Ugaritic (a precursor of Hebrew) ‚Äì with reasonable success (no luck so far with the older, and as-yet undeciphered Linear A).

First, word-to-word relations for a specific language are mapped, using vast databases of text. The system searches texts to see how often each word appears next to every other word. This pattern of appearances is a unique signature that defines the word in a multidimensional parameter space. Researchers estimate that languages ‚Äì all languages ‚Äì can be best described as having 600 independent dimensions of relationships, where each word-word relationship can be seen as a vector in this space. This vector acts as a powerful constraint on how the word can appear in any translation the machine comes up with.

In a draft proposal issued on Friday (Dec 27), the central bank said the new framework would allow for internet-based banking products and services that could address gaps in the market for potential underserved and unserved customers. The new lenders will have access to the country's shared ATM network.

The move by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) comes as regulators across Asia opening up banking sectors to new digital players using technology to offer financial services.

12/31/19, 13:17 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS COMMUNITY TOP LEADERS SAYING*

*Question 1* isn‚Äôt this is very bad. Govt is interfering in the commercial arrangements that are dealt by RBI

*Question 2*

What happens to that ‚Äúpatent‚Äù of UPI QR in POS now ?

Ultimately, a POS machine will be optimum for RuPay and UPI.


Please opine
12/31/19, 13:22 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: It will ultimately depend on Customer and some what on Issuers, what they want to adopt. When everyone has a Mobile and the Shops have Low Cost QR or UPI Pull Request, the PoS will become obsolete for Debit Card usage. But will require for Credit Card.
12/31/19, 13:49 - Vikas Business Phone: *Question 3* Are you saying that POS will only accept Rupay & UPI 
if NPCI patent that they filed get accepted???
12/31/19, 13:49 - Vikas Business Phone: *Question 4* Are Banks making changes effective tonight ? Any idea on what will happen to interchange and the other costs of the acquirers for enabling these transactions..
12/31/19, 13:56 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: First it will take 4-5 years. They filed on 28/12/2017. So atleast 2022. 
If the patent is Granted (It will as it's an Intl Patent), then NPCI may start charging licensing Fees for anyone who uses UPI platform. Mostly Issuer Banks.
12/31/19, 14:00 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community thought leader give thumbs up üëçto this move by the Government*

This is a directive to ensure Rupay Debit Card & UPI are Defacto, while other Payment Methods are optional, in case of any Business, that does >50 Crore turnover.

While this is like paving Red Carpet to UPI & Rupay over other Payment Methods, *this is still not bad, as Government didnot force Merchants to not offer payment methods.*

I remember Microsoft, who led Web Browser Market with it's own Internet Explorer Browser. People used it alot, and Netscape, fought a War that it cannot win, since it cannot replace IE, as long as Microsoft backed it.

what Happened?

Netscape created Mozilla Foundation and Firefox is Born.

If and when Rupay/UPI become monopolies without Value in the Service, we will surely see Mozilla Firefox kind of Collaborative Effort.

But by observing the way it is happening, I donot foresee such situation anywhere in near future...., unless and otherwise, different developments happen in NPCI/RBI/Government.

Note: While I always Expect Government to play the role of Facilitator, I also Expect it to have one of the Contender, as Public Limited Company of the Government, so, possibilities of Collusion and Market Monopoly can be prevented, while Government can rescue Markets from such scenarios.

The Market is HUGE, as long as Government DONOT Prevent Other Payment Methods, I feel, it is good to go, and India is vast for many to come and serve the last mile.
12/31/19, 14:18 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community leader on PATENT ON POS* 

He says 
the patent in a POS terminal was a "jugaad" solution in my opinion. the ideal QR code solution should be a dynamic QR code, placed clearly visible to the customer and easily scannable by a customer mobile application. The world over, QR codes are handled on a dedicated terminal / screen, conveniently placed for the customer to view, scan and transact. Getting the QR on a POS terminal and then presenting it to the customer to scan and transact is not the best / optimal solution.
12/31/19, 14:30 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community thought leader FIAKS Maven & FIAKS Award winner on Q1 gives thumbs down üëéto the government*

When Govt becomes a player, rule maker and regulator all rolled into one , there is huge conflict of interest and distortion of market forces. There will be little selling power or incentive left for other players and they will whittle down their activities slowly. As with many other policies of this govt, short term gains drive decisions with scant consideration for long term repurcussions.

Most Chinese users won't have to lift a finger to take advantage of the new network. About 70 percent of Chinese smartphones already support Beidou, according to Nikkei. There are already 120 partners lined up to use Beidou for mapping technology.

*Q6* Will merchant now dictate which card he will prefer to accept?

*Q7*. What's the signalling to other networks like Visa ,MC, Amex: will they also go to zero?

*Q8* Can anyone clarify if this applies to banks also ? I mean the word business does it cover banks in India ?
12/31/19, 15:58 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community thought leader shared anonymously his views and says MDR zero is a great initiative üëçüëçüëç*

He says Our Acquring business / channels have been influenced by western worlds primarily USA which is more of Credit Card economy where both merchants as well as consumers are ok with paying incremental fees in form of MDR to PSP / ISO ... But India is like China -a Debit card driven economy  and solution of UPI has been blended with mobile / digital ecosystem starting with UPI which is competing with Cash in the market and not with the cards Acquring .... Our perspective of looking at the new Acquring model has to be from the point that what‚Äôs the cost of managing cash for a small merchants including issues like fake currency / soiled notes etc .... additionally the model would further evolve where in Banks / FinTechs / acquirers have to offer VAS services like Lending / EMI / Loyalty programs / DCC etc enhance the revenue and not just focus on MDR as a sole revenue like item .... Data Analytics for merchants would play a key role for merchants to decide on which bank / partner to work with !!!!

It's not just an e-commerce and shopping giant, cloud provider, device-maker or software-and-services platform ‚Äî it's also a money-making leviathan with tentacles stretching into new industries and markets, which makes it tough to define.

The most accurate way to figure Amazon out is to follow the money. Statista compared Amazon's Q2 2018 and 2019 results to break down how the various segments of Amazon's business are growing. In every sector except physical stores such as Whole Foods (which remained flat), Amazon's revenue grew year over year.

While merger and acquisition activity lagged 2018 for much of the year, a surge of deal-making in the final quarter drove the value of takeovers worldwide to $3.9 trillion in 2019, 3% lower than the previous year, according to figures compiled by data provider Refinitiv.

It makes 2019 the fourth biggest year for M&A since Refinitiv‚Äôs records began in 1980 and the sixth consecutive year to surpass $3 trillion. The sheer volume of deals, however, was down slightly year-on-year as the following table shows.

1/3/20, 10:15 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Again Questions* : on ZERO MDR 

I go to hotel for breakfast. My Bill is Rs 100. I have two option to pay. Cash or by card 


*Option 1*
 I go to ATM withdraw Rs 100 and pay 

*Option 2*
I swipe card which has 1% OR 2%  MDR 


*Customer perspective* : he is ok to withdraw money and pay Rs  100

*Merchant perspective*
He doesn't want to pay 1% to POS company. He very happy accepting cash 

*By Making MDR Zero*
Don't you think digital mode will be more acceptable to customer & merchant? 



*Pls note- We will take up impact on payment ecosystem, digitalisation, job loss and other issues separately* 


Please try to opine only on the above question
1/3/20, 10:39 - +91 90233 89243: For a layman consumer MDR is not known except if the merchant passes the cost to the him. For Merchant, it would be easier to accept digital modes if there is no cost involved, however most of the merchants are not knowing benefits of going digital, digital literacy is missing.
1/3/20, 10:55 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: Isn't mdr zero a fictitious construct? Does it actually make the cost zero? No. It certainly removes 'profiteering' possibilities, but making the bank pay for it is the same as ultimately making the customer pay. 

Promoting and distribution of digital money will require money. If mdr played a role in contributing to this kitty, what will fill this void? 

Just like for cash,  we conveniently ignore the capex and opex of operating an ATM and the fact that ultimately this cost IS borne by the customer.  This may be 'hidden' for many customers, but it's still there. Even notionally this cost is > Rs. 10

On the pos side again, there is a possibility of cash@pos where the merchant gets paid for facilitating the 'withdrawal'. This is definitely way more cost optimized overall compared to an ATM, but is not popular here. Definitely a win for the merchant. Is this still alive? Why it is not popular? Will zero mdr change things?
1/3/20, 10:58 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on ZERO MDR says* 

*View 13*. CXO BANKER Anonymously 

Only Rupay & UPI is made Zero  MDR 

*If Mastercard, Visa and Amex feel that MDR can be charged for below mentioned benefits and customer will pay for this convenience. Then they can go ahead. The regulation is not stopping them Right ?*

*View 8* CXO CARD ASSOCIATION 

I think the very tenet of why the merchant ecosystem came about is being questioned in option 2 - there are challenges with cash - 1. Infrastructure to count the cash at end of the day - 2. Storing the cash safely by the merchant 3. Fraudulent notes 4. Ensuring no error done by the staff when accepting cash ( counting errors ) 5. Cash pilferage by staff - all these items add up to make it expensive - especially if the merchant is a popular outlet with a good sales turnover .... add to this the economic cost of printing cash and delivering it safely for consumption in the country ... and the whole discussion around black money and tax pilferage associated with cash ...having said the above - a question worth debating is - what‚Äôs the right cost structure for a merchant so that all payments can be digital
1/3/20, 11:20 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Banking_: *Physical branches might not be a lost cause for banks - Business Insider*

In Business Insider Intelligence's recent Digital Banking Ecosystem report, we showed that physical bank branches are on the decline, in contrast to the rising popularity of digital channels like online and mobile: In the UK, one-third (3,300) of all bank branches closed in the past five years as of September 2019, while in the US there was a net decrease of 9% of branches nationwide in the past decade.

However, it's worth noting that for many incumbent banks, branches remain an invaluable source of revenue. At Chase, for instance, the vast majority (80%) of its customer transactions are completed through self-service channels, but a massive 70% of its deposit growth between 2014 and 2018 came from households that frequent branches.

1/3/20, 11:27 - Vikas Business Phone: *Thought leader from Cooperative Bank on ZERO MDR*-  CEO 

He says 

Ex RBI DG Chakraworthy once said Rs 100 note is best digital instrument  because the value of that currency  note remains same for carrying  out 51st transaction  

In POS , Card Swipe or any digital  transaction  of 100 bugs minimum expenses to be borne  by either end user or/& merchant  are 2 ruppes 
Hence original  100 rupees  shall be entirely  wiped out in 50 transactions  by way of charges / fees to be paid to channel partners 
Who are these beneficiaries and whats their cost ?
Whats the  % of profitability of merchant in such small transactions  and whats the volume  of the same shall decide his interest in digital  transaction  up to Rs 100

That signals a potentially big year for go-private deals, with firms such as Blackstone Group and Carlyle wielding war chests of roughly $1.45 trillion after raising their cash holdings by 12.4 percent in 2019, according to the financial-data provider Preqin.

The private-equity firm KKR, in November, reportedly approached Walgreens Boots Alliance about a go-private deal that could be the largest leveraged buyout in history. The transaction hasn't yet been sealed because of the large amount of financing required, but it could be wrapped up this year, according to Bloomberg.

1/3/20, 18:34 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: While it is ok to presume that the customer does not mind going to the ATM, there is a cost to the customer as well to withdraw currency. Banks have already limited how many withdrawals can be made in a month for free. So, potentially if I'm eating at a restaurant unlimited number of times a month, then that is comparable to paying by card unlimited times as MDR is the same for 1st and 100th use. 

Hence for the average Joe there is a cost for ATM usage to the consumer whereas on card there is no cost ever to the consumer.

"Our vision and goal is to replace passwords with biometrics," said Zake Huang, Vice President of AuthenTrend. "Password-less authentication has been widely adopted in Microsoft's Azure AD identity management solution. Google also announced the launch of its hardware security keys in 2017 to protect its 85000 employees from hacks and phishing. We can thus foresee a future without passwords."

Over the holidays, the Russian government said it had completed a multi-day test of a national, internal internet known as RuNet, a bid to show that the country's online infrastructure could survive even if disconnected from the rest of the world. Though Russia claims the initiative relates to cybersecurity, researchers and human rights advocates inside Russia and around the world argue that the test underscores Russia's broader campaign to control and censor access to digital information within its borders.

Annuities are insurance or investment contracts that give investors regular payments in exchange for a lump sum paid upfront.

However some financial professionals argue that they come with high commissions and opaque disclosures. Because that puts individual investors at a disadvantage, they say, some have sworn off selling them.

However, the robot, being open-source, is capable of so much more. Developers can use Python to create myriad applications for the system, while the robot's modular nature allows for any number of applications whether that's food service, customer service, demonstrations or good old fashioned research and development. The system comes with built-in AI which should help developers jump straight into the meat of their research without first having to train up the machine learning component.

You‚Äôre offered a loan or a discount at the moment you need it, at the time you‚Äôre making a purchase. 

In five years, banking will be behind the scenes, embedded in everyday activities.

Why it matters: The country‚Äôs regulators have redoubled a crackdown on illegal and risky financial practices such as peer-to-peer lending.

Nearly 100,000 internet finance apps were found by a government-affiliated think tank to have high-risk vulnerabilities. Many finance apps have been accused of over-collecting user data and privacy infringement.
Shenzhen, with its proximity to Hong Kong, is playing an increasingly significant role in finance and technology innovation in the Greater Bay Area. The city is a key site for researching and promoting government-led financial technology and blockchain initiatives.

If we Refer page 3 B) the official of RE shall perform video KYC. While this shall be perfect for assisted journeys, but the customer self journey will hardly see much change. However, it is paperless, which is also a major benefit and use case !!

*View 11*
To be honest, the market was waiting for this. However many had hoped that Customer Self Service would be solved, so it's a bit of a dampner. No matter, that may come later, hopefully. But still, a lot of challenges would be resolved, no doubt

May be the Ecosystem still needs some time to attain that mature state of seamless ness

The good thing is that BC agent can also assist in onboarding. Approval still needs to be done by bank employee only. Earlier Bc agent was restricted only to ekyc or non osv route only.

1/10/20, 00:14 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member master KYC circular* he adds

RBI has just released a new Video KYC regulation that applies to *all regulated entities (not just banks)*. This means there is no longer any need for physical presence to onboard new users. Here are the details -
1. The video capture must be triggered from the regulated entity's domain (presumably to prevent phishing). *So google duo or facetime CANNOT be used*
2. The *user must be based based in India* (as demonstrated by the geotag collected during the session)
3. The session requires both the user and an employee of the regulated entity to be present simultaneously
4. The *user must present PAN card AND complete his eKYC (relevant for banks) OR provide his Aadhaar XML*. The Aadhaar *XML cannot be more than 3 days old*. Most users today find it difficult to provide an XML file. Also if the XML is old they will have fetch it again. The journey can be really cumbersome and complicated
5. The circular actually encourages AI based facematch, although it places the *accountability for client due diligence squarely with the regulated entity*.
1/10/20, 01:07 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Why does GoI and RBI need to make things so complicated ? What‚Äôs the big deal if the person is not physically in India at that moment ? It takes 30 seconds to login thru a VPN with servers in India so such deterrents are not effective in any case.

If it‚Äôs geotag only then are they expecting video kyc to be done from phone only? That‚Äôs even more confounding. 

With all due respect to RBI did they look at how leading global regtech products are doing digital kyc?
1/10/20, 01:07 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: That being said, it‚Äôs a welcome move but unnecessarily complicated
1/10/20, 06:52 - +91 90233 89243: Great points, however why do you think phone kyc would be difficult? Video KYC can also be used as address proof as well(no 100% accuracy ) though I agree since the public domains are not allowed it would be a lot more difficult for banks etc to develop such a platform, good opportunity for fintechs, i think.

*Q1* How come this zero MDR does not apply to *FasTag*? 4% MDR on every FASTag transaction on toll. Of which 1.5% goes to the issuer bank, 1.25% to the acquirer bank, 1% to IHMCL and 0.25% to NPCI. ü§îü§î

*Q2* Do you think Government will reimburse MDR to the bank? Will bank share that with payment companies? And all these reimbursement will be  made timely ? üîî

*Q3* Not all companies are GOOGLE & FACEBOOK and planning to make money from data. That‚Äôs a long way out. You need to sustain for a long time to really see it happen

*Q4* Nation can only get built with *strong companies* over a longboard term profitable model. Subsidies does not build nation but destroys it systematically...  isn‚Äôt it ?

*Q6* Isn't the *GOVT* the biggest beneficiary with *GST* being collected? Why can't the govt be subsidising the ZEROMDR - isn't that the WIN/WIN/WIN?

10. Australia üá¶üá∫
0.86 billion (10.60%)

The annual report discovered global parcel volume reached 87 billion in 2018, up from 74bn parcels in 2017 and the highest since the Index began. Despite unprecedented global trade uncertainty, the report forecasts this figure will more than double within the next six years and reach 200 billion parcels by 2025.

The Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index measures both volume and spend for B2B, B2C, C2B and consumer consigned shipments with weight up to 31.5 kg (70 lbs.) in 13 major markets, representing 3.7 billion people.

*Key findings include:*

- China‚Äôs parcel industry volumes achieved CAGR of 41 percent from 2013-2018. Volume grew 26 percent year-over-year although this growth has declined from the 48-61 percent growth seen from 2012-16

- United States ranks highest in the Index for parcel shipping revenue at $119bn.

- Brazil sees the second highest year-over-year growth rate in the Index with a 25 percent increase in year-over-year parcel volume from 2017-18

- India is experiencing CAGR of 25% in parcel volume 2013-18 and year-over-year growth of 21 percent

 *The impact of emerging ecommerce markets such as Brazil and India is strongly evident in the figures.* Brazil‚Äôs year-over-year percentage growth in parcel volume reached 25 percent in 2018 ‚Äì second only to China - as 738m parcels were shipped. This growth comes despite the economic slowdown in Brazil, as ecommerce and logistics partnerships help shift the market.

India also experienced high growth in parcel volumes in 2018, up *21 percent year-over-year to 2.5bn*, and revenues achieving CAGR of 20 percent, boosted by rapid growth in its ecommerce market, higher levels of disposable income and increased internet penetration.

1/13/20, 11:20 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Data:_ *How Is Data Being Used In The Insurance Industry?*

Today, data can be pulled from almost every aspect of our lives. Technology is implemented into everything we do, from our workouts to the food we buy to how fast we drive our cars. Insurance underwriters have mass amounts of data at their fingertips, which plays a huge role in the underwriting process, and most insurance programs will try to accelerate the process by pulling from key databases. Underwriters are looking at public data such as MIB, motor vehicle records, prescription and drugs records, health records, among other sources, to determine policies. Of course, all of this data complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Recently, we‚Äôre seeing companies begin to use implicit data available to determine customer risk and mortality. With devices such as Fitbits or Apple Watches, companies and underwriters have access to a wealth of fitness and health data they can analyze in the underwriting process. In the future, there‚Äôs a scenario where someone may have a higher premium based on poor health records or weight, but is still able to lower their premiums by improving their wellness with activities tracked by data from their fitness wearable.

In simple words, Juice Jacking is an *attack carried out by hackers through a USB charging cable*. When a user plugs in the charging cable in his mobile‚Äôs charging port, and connects it to any of the rigged charging stations installed at public spaces such as airports, train stations, hotels, cafes etc ‚Äì it gives a back-door entry to hackers into the compromised device. The charging port which is also used for data transfer over the USB, is pointed as the main cause of concern over here. Installing malware, cleaning user data, asking ransom in exchange for access to personal data on the phone, personal and financial account hijacking are just some of the many nefarious things that a hacker can do with this unrestricted access.

A hacker that manages to compromise a modem using cable haunt gains full control over the inbound and outbound traffic from it. Because a cable modem sits in front of the router, every device on the network is put at risk.

If the cards (debit) are not enabled for CNP, will that not impact enrollment on UPI?
1/15/20, 21:36 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS COMMUNITY RESPONSE* cxo card association

No. For UPI enrolment, you need an active debit card. Not linked with CNP enabled or not.

1/15/20, 22:21 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member CXO card association is asking on RBI circular*

Regulators are more concerned about fraud related to cards. Hence the regulation. We welcome.

*Not making similar for UPI surprises me* ü§î


Is it that *UPI FRAUDS* acceptable to Regulator? Or am I missing something here
1/15/20, 23:45 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community responses on why not enhance security to UPI As well like cards* here are few views rest will be in bespoke reports 

*View 24*
UPI fraud is due to negligence if customer and collect/receive money option. The architecture is super secured as on date.

*View 12*
Ha ! UPI already has its share of Collect request frauds already. Just that registration process is not linked with Card CNP status as this check will make the process more tedious and registration failure will go up
IMO, Providing Controls to customer on txn limits, enable/ disable on diff txn types is a good move.

*View 14*
But mandatory opt-in for CNP, contactless even for domestic txn is a step back considering the need to push digital txns. Banks anyway have responsibility to put risk bass control mechanism on all txns

*View 15*
This was brought specifically to control the vishing, that rampantly happened in wallets and UPI. Pressure from Govt. Came to know that finance minister's office was flooded with fraudulent transaction related complaints, especially the recent PAYTM frauds.

*View 22*
Let‚Äôs remember that security and convenience never speak to each other.  Whenever we introduce new security measure, the first thing in our minds should be how would a layman approach this!
When the big card frauds happened a few years back, we realised how vulnerable a customer is, to the vagaries of the system. As a result, We introduced a unique on/off toggle for all digital debits in a customers account. I strongly believe that putting a limit only on card alone may be insufficient as we a country have a boutique of payment options. What‚Äôs also risky, is that we provide the convenience for reset of a forgot credential in one channel, say ATM PIN using netbanking or mobile.  In the ground, it‚Äôs all about how effective is your messaging...

Your car knows all about you ‚Äì your habits, where you like to go and when, and maybe even what sort of temperament you have. Cameras inside cars even track your eyes to see whether you‚Äôre watching the road.

If you spent as much time one-on-one with a friend as you do with your car, your friend would know an awful lot about you, too. The difference is that car companies, unlike friends, have a financial incentive for knowing things about you.

No.1
*Jensen Huang (NVIDIA)*

No.2
*Marc Benioff (Salesforce)*

No.3
*Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault(Kering)*

*Rankings from 4-10 are as follows:*

6. Shantanu Narayen (Adobe)

7. Ajay Banga (Mastercard)

1/20/20, 11:16 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS bespoke_ : *Are Bank deposits Safe In Today's Era*

If depositors are allowed to buy deposit insurance from outside companies to protect themselves, which only means that depositors will shift the risk from one financial entity (bank) to another financial entity (insurer). Most likely if a big bank fails it will take down the insurer also.

If a loan is covered by insurance in case of a person‚Äôs demise, why not his deposit be covered by insurance in case of demise of the institution!
http://bit.ly/38hfGXd
1/20/20, 11:46 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community on deposit insurance post*

*Views* - _Executive Director MNC bank_
This needs to be tested. So far RBI has stepped in to take care of the depositors. Furthermore there are no firm indications that RBI will not do the same again

*View* -  _Fintech Founder_ 
In this case, Insurance Companies need to have a Forum that helps them know and analyze Bank's happenings, and have their say, when malicious events happen in Bank and that donot take down the insurance company when bank goes down.

On other hand, Insurance Companies will surely have additional revenue for the risk they undertake.

Summary:

I personally aspire to See Banks Strong by themselves and be responsible for Every Rupee Deposited with them. While Banks are Asking their Customers to Insure provided loans (in the context of default due to Customer Death or whatever reason be so), Bank Customers Cannot go to Insurance Company to Secure their Deposits, as in that case, we DONOT NEED Banks, even though the Purpose & required Expertise needed to run Banks & Insurance Companies are Different

Amazon has plans to create payment terminals that would allow shoppers to link a credit card with their own handprint, allowing them to pay at brick-and-mortar stores by simply waving their hand across a scanner, according to a report Saturday from The Wall Street Journal.

The WSJ reported that discussions to create the pay-by-hand terminals are in their early stages, though Amazon has already begun the development process with Visa and is in talks to work with MasterCard.

But rather than take any enforcement against companies it suspects of law breaches it has today issued another mildly worded blog post ‚Äî in which it frames what it admits is a ‚Äúsystemic problem‚Äù as fixable via (yet more) industry-led ‚Äúreform‚Äù.

Yet it‚Äôs exactly such industry-led self-regulation that‚Äôs created the unlawful adtech mess in the first place, data protection experts warn.

Google this week announced that the company will take steps to eventually eliminate third-party cookies, routinely used by data brokers to closely track and profit from your browsing behavior. But experts say that while the company‚Äôs announcement is a good first step, the effort is belated, murky, and not quite the revolution it‚Äôs being portrayed as. 

In a blog post, Justin Schuh, Director of Chrome Engineering, announced that the company‚Äôs Chrome browser would be moving away from using third-party cookies sometime in the next two years. First party cookies would still be allowed, but third party cookies used to track you around the internet would eventually be banned.

http://bit.ly/2v3SbCx
1/21/20, 13:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Google is killing third party cookies because it helps them dominate the internet ad landscape more, not less.
1/21/20, 13:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Through the years many people, advertisers, businesses, saas, martech product companies have figured out ways to own and attribute these cookies without necessarily passing on money to Google directly or indirectly.
1/21/20, 13:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
1/21/20, 13:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Killing this, since they already own Chrome and Android. Apart from this iOS is already trying to kill ad info on their phones, soon will become standard on all Apple devices - everybody just wants a larger commission of their sales enablement.
1/21/20, 13:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Essentially killing third party benefits them the most, while keeping other ad products in check, killing competition, increasing ad prices via info Google owns, giving their ad customers no real choice, and monopolising the business more and more. Also fends of Facebook, increasingly soon other social networks.
1/21/20, 13:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You will see great revenue hacks from Google this year across their entire ecosystem and next which is basically why the founders are now in non-executive roles, while the executives in charge do all the dirty revenue work per se.

And if we do not facilitate the opportunity to learn new skills, we will leave people behind without the necessary competences to the detriment of workers as well as businesses.

The World Economic Forum‚Äôs focus on a Reskilling Revolution is timely. If we want to construct a future where we take advantage of the opportunities and create fairer and more inclusive labour markets, we need to act now. And we need strong partnerships.

Law firm Maurice Blackburn will on Wednesday launch a class action lawsuit against National Australia Bank for delaying the move of $6.3bn belonging to more than 330,000 super customers to low-fee accounts ‚Äì a decision that allowed the big four bank‚Äôs financial advisers to continue to reap lucrative fees.

The lawsuit, to be filed in the Victorian supreme court, will accuse two NAB subsidiaries that acted as superannuation trustees, Nulis Nominees (Australia) and MLC Nominees, of failing in their duty to put fund members first when there was a conflict of interest.

 *Nothing for Money: A Behavioural Perspective on Innovation and Motivation*

Encouraging the type of creative thinking that leads to innovation is no easy task for an organization. These are intrinsically motivated behaviors, and traditional economic incentives do not always work. Thankfully, there are impactful alternatives, which start with individuals developing a shared sense of community. When you have a specific problem that requires an innovative mind, tournaments are a great tool to spur innovative thinking. More generally, if you are looking to instill a 24/7 type of innovative mindset in your employees, it‚Äôs important to build a climate that promotes organizational citizenship. And when the time comes to reward innovations, make sure that these creative efforts are widely recognized and celebrated, even if they do fail from time to time

*Credit Sussie has red flagged Reliance Industries 65 Billion US Dollar debt*.

One Billion US Dollar is around 7200 Crores as per dollar exchange rate of the day. In total the debt of Mukesh Ambani (what is officially known of course, there are other debts hidden off balance sheets and in obscure companies) is a massive *4,68,000 Crores*.

Now assuming that he is paying an average of 10% interest on this debt, his yearly interest payment on this debt is 46,800 Crores. Divide this by 365 and you get 128 odd crores per day or about *5.33 Crores per hour*. Does he or his companies earn that kind of money? I doubt.

No wonder Credit Sussie has red flagged this debt.

Mukesh Ambani is also aware of this dangerous situation. That is why he has put up 25% of his company's stake for sale. He is trying to sell assets that he created out of this debt.

It is not a fire sale as yet but it could become a fire sale soon. 

Soon Mukesh Ambani will learn the hard way that the banker is a person who lends his umbrella to someone till it is not raining and wants it back immediately as soon as it starts to rain.   ............

Also with lakhs of crores Rupees debt to Indian banks , Mukesh Ambanis  Reliance industries is main culprit behind mounting NPA of our banking system itself...This is stated as one among major reason for economic slow down forecasted in India....

1/26/20, 18:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Do all Banks have corporate credit cards? Both hard and soft.
1/26/20, 18:37 - Fintech Monica Jasuja Mastercard IiNC: Not all
1/26/20, 19:06 - Vikas Business Phone: It's a big opportunity to tap leadership teams but unfortunately requirements laid by the banks are unacceptable to SME
1/26/20, 19:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Like what?
1/26/20, 19:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am trying to understand why this is not a big thing? Or is it a big thing and I don‚Äôt know? Can someone enlighten me?
1/26/20, 19:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why just leadership? Anyone in the company should be given a card if the company backs up the person as guarantor. Where is the risk attached?
1/26/20, 19:14 - Vikas Business Phone: Companies don't want to guarantee it's staff spending unless it's an approved expense
1/26/20, 19:14 - Vikas Business Phone: Companies want all liabilities to staff
1/26/20, 19:14 - Vikas Business Phone: Then it's better staff takes the card directly
1/26/20, 19:15 - Vikas Business Phone: Without involvement of institution
1/26/20, 19:17 - +91 90046 19987: My opinion is generally corporate cards are given to those who travel. Even these days companies are passing payment liability to employees for their official spend then they can claim. It‚Äôs same of corporate mobiles
1/26/20, 19:17 - Vikas Business Phone: Ideal scenario to 

Corporate cards are in the name of the company 

Company takes the ownership of card payment with the bank 

Company signs a simple undertaking that all expenses needs to be approved else it will be deducted from salary or it takes a risk on employee
1/26/20, 19:17 - Vikas Business Phone: Doing all this had too much hassle hence SME avoid
1/26/20, 19:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What if company wants to guarantee?
1/26/20, 19:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes
1/26/20, 19:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Now if this is the case, are there folks who give corporate credit cards?
1/26/20, 19:44 - Fintech Monica Jasuja Mastercard IiNC: Happay
1/26/20, 19:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Thank you
1/26/20, 19:56 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: I have been in a company where corporate cards were given to us for business expenses. However, the responsibility of payments was on us. The facility only provided us with 15-45 days to claim the expenses which the company would then reimburse to us and we didn't have to bear the brunt of the payment on our pockets. The credit card company did have an API integration with the company where the card expense would load directly into the employee portal and the employee could seek manager approval through the portal via a workflow. The employees could of course enjoy the loyalty points and did not have to pay the annual fees usually associated with premium credit cards.
1/26/20, 19:57 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: This is a mechanism to ensure that expenses are settled and billed as close to the incurrence of the expense which leads to better billing discipline, at least for the services sector.
1/26/20, 19:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes but there is a completely different reality where someone would want to empower their employees to buy stuff on behalf of the company and then the company can pay the amount in 45 days.
1/26/20, 20:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: How is consumer credit easier to trust than corporate credit?
1/26/20, 20:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Shouldn‚Äôt it be other way around?
1/26/20, 20:07 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Isnt that debit?
1/26/20, 20:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is very interesting - Is nobody doing company backed employee purchase credit?

This is a big opportunity, so why isn‚Äôt anyone doing it?

What am I missing here?
1/26/20, 20:18 - +65 9732 7516: There are two kinds of corp cards- CCCL and CCIL ( Corp cards corp liability and individual liability)

Few Cos end up preferring ccil  due to behavioural reasons and tech reasons.
Beh- When people spend from own pocket and then claim.. higher chance that they will spend as per corp policies.
Tech- api to clarify and simplify claims filing. 

Due to this the above mentioned beh of cccl being given to limited set of senior people
1/26/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Who is doing CCCL?
1/26/20, 20:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or even CCIL, in India.
1/26/20, 20:19 - +65 9732 7516: All big banks have cccl. But requires manual policy work at bank and client end  and hence not a big portfolio
1/26/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And what are the limits?
1/26/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Oh my God ok so not productised.
1/26/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Very very interesting.

1/26/20, 21:35 - +91 90046 19987: Till last month we use to have CCCL and now onwards moved to CCIL
1/26/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What was your learning from the market why you did this?
1/26/20, 22:11 - +91 90046 19987: Globally the liability is settled by the employees and corporate stands as guarantor to the Card company
1/26/20, 22:12 - Vikas Business Phone: This is the issue
1/26/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Confident of new people seeing it differently
1/26/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The real reason seems to be that default is the business of credit cards
1/26/20, 22:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Corporates won‚Äôt default as much or will default 100%
1/26/20, 22:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Depending on how you understand underwriting
1/26/20, 22:14 - Vikas Business Phone: Employee is travelling or doing expenses for the company 

Why should he/she take a liability
1/26/20, 22:15 - Vikas Business Phone: Bank can give 100 cr loan to SME  but can't take exposure on credit card spending by the employee of SME? 

WHY? Opportunities for product innovation
1/26/20, 22:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So no business case for Banks because they won‚Äôt be making default money or they will have bad NPAs because of their inability to understand book based credit-worthy ness (this seems weirdly counter intuitive - I mean isn‚Äôt this the entire point of being a bank - risk distribution)
1/26/20, 22:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Happening. Let the banks wake up later and buy the startup later. Seems to be the norm.
1/26/20, 22:27 - +91 90233 89243: This message was deleted
1/26/20, 22:31 - +91 90046 19987: But corporate either don‚Äôt want to take that responsibility either these days. If they do so employees take much time to settle their spends
1/26/20, 23:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Smart bet. Another way to ask the question - Is there a Cred for business? Because there certainly is scope.
1/26/20, 23:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Well companies might want to and this must be a pretty decent number overall, esp startups.
1/26/20, 23:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Clearly there is need

1/27/20, 12:36 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _e-commerce_ : *Department Stores Dying A Death Of A Thousand Cuts - And What Walmart Is Doing Differently*

Some of the thousand cuts were inflicted by shifting markets, generational changes, and cultural trends. But mostly they were self-inflicted by the failure of managements of once rock-solid brands like Sears to adapt and redefine their identities. Imagine what Sears could have done in its battle with Home Depot and Lowe‚Äôs with its once most-admired brand equity and a heavy investment in technology. The same is true for Macy‚Äôs. Over the last decade they focused on shedding assets like their proprietary credit card along with selling real estate to prop up company value, as opposed to developing great products to delight their customer.

One of the more recent self-inflicted cuts was on display recently during a stroll through Bloomingdale‚Äôs flagship store in New York. Once upon a time, Bloomingdale‚Äôs (now owned by Macy‚Äôs [NYSE: M]), which just announced the closing of 29 Macy‚Äôs stores, was the urban-hip-fun place to find lifestyle goods you couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else. For decades Bloomingdale‚Äôs aggressively differentiated itself from all other retailers.

1/27/20, 13:31 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Facial Recognition:_ *How Facial Recognition Works*

The controversial and nearly ever-present technology that could replace the fingerprint. 

The sudden explosion of facial recognition into public consciousness can make it seem a force as unstoppable as the weather, but the technology didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. The first facial-recognition technology was arguably created by the French police officer Alphonse Bertillon more than a century ago. In the late 1800s, Bertillon devised a method for identifying criminals based on their physical features. The index cards assigned to each person included 11 physical measurements plus standardized photographic portraits and a ‚Äúverbal portrait.‚Äù This early biometric system allowed the body to be abstracted into information; it was ‚Äúa transformation of the body‚Äôs signs into text,‚Äù wrote the late critic Allan Sekula. In theory, this text made the process of identifying people less prone to human error. Bertillon‚Äôs system became widely used in France and soon spread to the United States, where it gained brief popularity until it was replaced by a much quicker and more reliable ruler: fingerprinting.

1/27/20, 15:18 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Identity Management_: *Use of the Social Security Number in France*

Under article 87 regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, member states may define the specific conditions for the processing of a national identification number or any other identifier of general application. As discussed below, France has made an interesting application of this rule regarding, in particular, the social security number. 

In France, the number referred to as ‚ÄúNIR‚Äù (which stands for ‚Äúnum√©ro d‚Äôindentificaiton nationale‚Äù or ‚Äúsocial security number‚Äù) has always required particular care and protection as it is the only unique identifier for each individual and is tied to personal data including gender and date of birth. The NIR may be used for identity theft while at the same time, be used as an error-free ID reference, for the purpose of combining data from various sources at a very large scale.

Therefore, France has provided for specific rules in relation to its use.

The Berlin state court's ruling cannot be appealed, although it is expected that both Facebook and the Germany‚Äôs main consumer protection organization, which brought the claim, will appeal against their inability to appeal.

A spokesperson for the consumer organization said they had an interest in appealing the decision so that the case could be analysed by a higher court, thus lending it more weight.

But the court said that Facebook‚Äôs erstwhile marketing claims that it is free ‚Äúand always will be‚Äù did not contravene consumer or privacy standards. The consumer protection organization had argued that the claim was misleading since consumers pay indirectly with their data.

1/27/20, 19:02 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Wealth Management_ *What Fintech Means for Advisors*

What does it all mean for advisors? First, it‚Äôs clear that investors expect digital tools as part of their relationship with their financial advisor. They enjoy online collaboration and digital tools in other parts of their lives, so why shouldn‚Äôt they when it comes to managing their wealth?

Second, advisors need to ensure they are communicating with clients in new and different ways. Not all clients have time to come into the office

Third, there's the question of value ‚Äì more specifically, clients understanding the value that their advisors deliver.

 *The ROI in workplace mental health programs: Good for people, good for business*

(A blueprint for workplace mental health programs)

Poor mental health among the workforce imposes tremendous costs on Canadian employers. Yet barriers to investment in workplace mental health remain, including a lack of knowledge of best practices, as well as a lack of evidence that such investments can have a positive impact on the bottom line. To overcome these barriers, Canadian employers require real-world evidence that workplace mental health programs are an investment that yields valuable returns, rather than a cost. This study, the first of its kind conducted within the Canadian context, provides such evidence.

 *Indian Economic Forum 2019*

This report covers key highlights and conclusions from the India Economic Forum, as well as offering a range of news, market insights and proprietary research to help you understand what lies ahead for India ‚Äî and how you can access its $5 trillion opportunity.

Featuring a keynote address by Shaktikanta Das, governor of the 
Reserve Bank of India, this year‚Äôs forum focused on India‚Äôs aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024. This goal has the potential 
to make India the next big emerging-market opportunity for global 
investors ‚Äî but with ongoing geopolitical tensions and slowing 
growth, the precise ingredients that will help India realise that ambition are unclear. Whether India‚Äôs capital markets can support the necessary GDP growth is yet to be seen, as is how policy-makers will move to revive the country‚Äôs flagging economy.

CBA is hoping the Australian Taxation Office will allow individuals to consent to ‚Äúone-off sharing‚Äù of their tax data when applying for a loan, backing an idea first raised by Macquarie.

Macquarie‚Äôs personal banking arm raised the idea in August last year to help it meet responsible lending requirements.

The Australian Financial Review reported that ATO data could help banks cross-check what loan applicants told them - and catch instances where applicants over-estimated their income to secure larger loans than they could service.

There was a curious talk held at the World Economic Forum, held in Davos, whose topic was entitled Creating a Credible and Trusted Digital Currency. The discussion tied together insight from policymakers and leaders in the digital currency field. Digital fiat, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), was the theme. The panel agreed that innovation should be encouraged ‚Äì but must be enforced by regulatory rules. The group said stablecoin competition and proliferation is a risk. Public use requires new regulations and faster payment systems. The feeling among the speakers supported study and innovation but cautioned against unknown consequences.

‚ÄúCosta Rica has some of the best healthcare in Latin America. There are two systems, both of which legal residents can access: the government-run universal healthcare system, Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, known as Caja, and the private system. Both health systems are constantly being upgraded‚Äînew clinics, new equipment, and improvements in staff training.

Despite the advancements, costs are low in comparison to those in the U.S.

‚ÄúOne of the reasons Costa Rica is so appealing for retirees, and expats in general, is because of the low-cost, excellent healthcare options,‚Äù says Kathleen Evans, IL Costa Rica Correspondent.

1/30/20, 11:29 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Insurance_: *Beware Medicare‚Äôs Part B Premium Penalty And Surcharge Traps*

In determining if you need to permanently pay a Medicare Part B penalty, Medicare counts all the months between age 65 and the month you first enroll in Part B even if you, like Sue, had a series of jobs with a largish employer with no gap between jobs extending beyond 8 months. Instead of being exempt from the penalty because she was always in a special enrollment periods between jobs, Sue was hit with a 20 percent lifetime Medicare Part B premium penalty! This is calculated based off of Medicare's base premium, which is $144.60 for 2020. Hence, Sue's penalty, this year, is $28.90 (.20 x $144.60) per month or $347.04 over the year. Moreover, since the base premium can rise, through time, faster than the rate of inflation, Sue's real penalty (her penalty measured in today's dollars) may be higher, indeed a lot higher, down the road.

Nike (NYSE:NKE) is the biggest athletic company on the planet, with $39.1 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2019 and a market capitalization of $163 billion. That gives it the ability to make moves that smaller companies can't, and it also gives the company the opportunity to lead retail trends. 

One intrepid move it recently made was to stop selling directly through Amazon. This was bold because current sentiment counts the Amazon platform as necessary for sales, since everyone is on Amazon. But Nike has pulled it off, and other companies have taken notice.

But talk to any of the best-known AI assistants today ‚Äî Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant ‚Äî and they‚Äôre not exactly conversational. They can tell you jokes, answer factual questions, and even respond to multiple queries without the need to keep repeating a wake word, but conversation or chit-chat is still very much a human endeavor

"I believe passionately that screen scraping should be prohibited as it is in the EU," she told the Senate Committee of Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology on Thursday.

Screen scraping is the process where customers give a third-party company, such as a fintech firm, permission to access their data before taking a "snapshot" of it and using it to deliver a service or product to the customer.

1/31/20, 12:03 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS Vdo 35_ *flash-charging technology* 

ABB‚Äôs 20-second flash-charging technology for  electric buses.

A TOSA bus looks in many ways similar to the various types of articulated buses used around the world. People may notice only that the electric TOSA bus is nearly silent, compared with the diesel buses prevalant in many urban areas. And of course the e-buses do not spew exhaust clouds when pulling away from the bus stop and accelerating into traffic.

The big difference, though, occurs when the TOSA bus reaches a stop equipped with a flash charging system. As soon as the bus arrives, a laser-controlled arm on the roof connects in less than a second to an overhead receptacle built into the bus shelter. The connection provides a high-power charge ‚Äì using a feed of up to 600 kilowatts. The boost recharges the battery enough to let the bus continue on its way.

(A Global Perspective)

This report throws into sharp relief the progress and lack of progress 
countries are making to increase diversity of their boardrooms and particularly the number of women serving on boards and their committees. This year‚Äôs report tells two tales. On one hand, we see countries like Germany, South Africa, Finland, and Malaysia that have increased the number of women on their boards by more than 6 percent since the last report. The results are plain in countries such as these, which have taken serious measures to address board diversity. Conversely, a number of countries have abysmally low rates of women serving on boards. *For example, Qatar and Saudi Arabia sit at the bottom, with only 0.6 and 0.7 percent of all board seats held by women, respectively* Perhaps worse, some staggering steps were taken  backwards too.

1/31/20, 18:23 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Banks will always argue that it‚Äôs bad technology. And they continue to keep off from opening up APIs which gave rise to screen scraping in the first place. 

There is no such thing as bad technology as long as it gets the work done and does not pose security risks. There has not been a single major incident of security breach because of screen scraping (to best of my knowledge).

Why ban something which is working well. API access should be mandated for all banks worldwide and North Am is notoriously slow in making progress on this. Even with API access I would be in favour of letting screen scraping coexist and let market forces decide which technology works better for their purpose.

1/31/20, 22:41 - OMLP2P Surendra jalan Ex Yes Bank NnR: Income tax department issues list of all official emails and SMS ids and inform taxpayers to not trust messages from any other source

Here is a full list of all official emails, SMS ids and websites used by the income tax department

The list of all email ids, SMS sender ids and even websites used by the taxman to communicate with taxpayers. To avoid any phishing attempts, the¬†income tax department¬†has asked all taxpayers to not open any messages from any sender other than the ones mentioned in the list.

"Always check, before you click. Trust only these sources," reads an email sent out to taxpayers and also warns them to never disclose their personal or financial details. Several taxpayers have reported phishing messages to the income tax department. Such fraudulent attempts made through SMSes and emails are often done to extract sensitive information from taxpayers by posing as officials from the¬†income tax department.

List of official emails used by the income tax team:

@incometax.gov.in

@incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in

@tdscpc.gov.in

@cpc.gov.in

@insight.gov.in

@nsdl.co.in

@utiitsl.com

The last two email ids belong to NSDL and UTIITSL, the only two agencies authorised by the I-T department to issue¬†PAN cards.

List of SMS source code or sender IDs used by the income tax dept:

ITDEPT

ITDEFL

TDSCPC

CMCPCI

INSIGT

SBICMP

NSDLTN

NSDLDP

UTIPAN

The last three ids are meant for PAN card related communication while the rest are used the I-T officials to send out various messages, reminders, etc to taxpayers.

Apart from this, the income tax department has two official websites --¬†www.incometaxindia.gov.in¬†and¬†www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in. The first one is a departmental website while the other one is meant for e-filing of income tax returns (ITR).

The I-T department also runs¬†www.tdscpc.gov.in¬†which gives out all information related to TDS (tax deduction at source). Other sites include www.insight.gov.in (compliance and reporting portal), www.nsdl.co.in and www.utiitsl.com (both for PAN cards).

"If you receive an e-mail for find a website you think is pretending to be of income tax department, forward the e-mail or SMS or website URL to webmanager@incometax.gov.in or incident@cert-in.org.in," the income tax department says.

2/2/20, 21:15 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS community thought Leader shared following information on the Budget 2020_ 

*Bilateral Netting* _will lay the foundation of a functioning corporate bond market in India_

The Union Budget announced yesterday has a number of radical measures that need elaboration. One of them is Bilateral Netting. This may seem like an arcane technical change, but it will lay the foundation of a functioning corporate bond market in India

*What is bilateral netting?* It allows two financial institutions to set off exposures to each other for the purposes of capital & margin. Illustration: Bank A has an exposure of Rs100 to Bank B, and Bank B has an exposure of Rs90 to Bank A. The gross exposure is Rs190 

‚ñ™With the imposition of capital requirements, the banks have to keep aside capital for Rs190. However, the net exposure is only Rs10. With bilateral netting, banks will only have to look at the net position thereby freeing up capital (in this illustration 19:1 ratio). 

‚ñ™Basel type capital requirements presume netting, and most countries already have it. India introduced Basel 3 without bilateral netting (multilateral is allowed). However, freeing up capital is not the biggest gain but the corporate bond market

‚ñ™Netting will allow development of a properly regulated corporate default swap market in line with international practice (RBI & SEBI are fully aware of the issues). In turn, this puts in place the necessary conditions for a liquid corporate debt market.

‚ñ™The Indian corporate bond market is effectively closed to most companies except the very largest. This opens the door for smaller companies to tap it. And yes, this will need to be properly regulated & supervised - including the integrity of rating agencies. 

‚ñ™In addition to the netting reform, the investment limit for FPIs in corporate bonds has been hiked from 9% to 15%. Other measures for boosting this market will be considered. Suggestions welcome.

Previously, part of the shares of technology companies belonged to foreign investors, Americans and Europeans - this means that almost half of the income from the heavy and chemical industries went not to the Treasury of China, but to the accounts of the "financial sharks" of Europe . 
Due to the situation in Wuhan , the yuan began to fall sharply, but the Central Bank did nothing to support the yuan. 
Even there were rumors that China simply does not have masks to fight the coronavirus.
These rumors and XI Jinping's statements that he is ready and will protect the population of Wuhan led to a big drop in the price of shares of Chinese technology companies, and "financial sharks" began to put the shares up for sale until they were completely devalued .
XI Jinping waited all week and only smiled at press conferences, and when the price fell below the plinth, he gave the command to sharply buy shares from all Europeans and Americans at the same time.
By the time these "financial sharks" realized that they had been tricked, it was too late: the shares were in the hands of the PRC. Not only did China earn more than $ 20 billion in these days, but it also returned shares of its companies to China. 
Now the income from technology and chemistry will not go abroad, but will remain in China, the yuan rises by itself, and you do not need to spend China's gold and foreign exchange reserves to support it, and the "financial sharks" of Europe are left with their noses, they have been deceived. 
In a matter of minutes, they bought shares for a penny that bring in billions of dollars, and left them without income from technology and chemistry . There has never been such a brilliant operation in the history of the stock market.
2/3/20, 17:35 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _security_: *Kraken Identifies Critical Flaw in Trezor Hardware Wallets*

This attack relies on voltage glitching to extract an encrypted seed. This initial research required some know-how and several hundred dollars of equipment, but we estimate that we (or criminals) could mass produce a consumer-friendly glitching device that could be sold for about $75.
We then crack the encrypted seed, which is protected by a 1-9 digit PIN, but is trivial to brute force.

The attack takes advantage of inherent flaws within the microcontroller used in the Trezor wallets. This unfortunately means that it is difficult for the Trezor team to do anything about this vulnerability without a hardware redesign. 

Until then, here is what you can do to protect yourself:

2/4/20, 12:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Will you risk it if it does?
2/4/20, 12:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the answer is no by default, the risk of doing so is far higher than the risk of not doing so.
2/4/20, 12:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nobody who can transfer 10 L plus at one shot from India will want that attention
2/4/20, 12:42 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: TCS is an obligation on the service provider. If the service provider does not deduct then the sender is not liable. IMO this announcement will invite further amendments or clarifications.
2/4/20, 12:45 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Technically yes. As you may know, there is no centralized way of monitoring aggregate amount of remittances by one taxpayer / PAN number.

Moreover many legit remittances will face unnecessary burden like tuition fees, medical expenses, buying shares overseas etc.
2/4/20, 12:47 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: The current LRS form asks you to self-declare your earlier remittances in the FY. That will (I expect) be trivially changed to ask this question of TCS. Circumventing, the way you described it, will require that person to give false info on this form - which, obviously, makes the option go away, legally speaking.
2/4/20, 13:05 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Yes I guess it‚Äôs risky to go down that path.

This is bound to create controversy too, as buying travel or shares overseas cannot be considered as taxable services delivered in India so why should the Govt be collecting tax on it. Ditto for tuition fees and medical expenses.

Overall, instead of making regulation simpler they are only complicating it and getting inspired by wrong examples followed by other countries (e.g. Brazil).

t's not hard to see why 2018 was not the best time for email marketing. There were those four letters of GDPR that dominated everything, prompting many brands to seek permission to keep on emailing people or suggesting they look at the company's new privacy policy online. 

Everyone knows what happened next. People wondered who all these companies asking to keep in touch were, and unsubscribe clicks went through the roof. Everything about email marketing in the UK went a shade below global averages.

However, in 2019, email marketing fought back, according to new research from Campaign Monitor. Although average open rates fell from 18% to 17.5% between 2018 to 2019, every other metric that matters improved.

The star of the show has to be click-through rates (CTR) which leapt from 0.9% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019.

People who buy these policies and believe them to be valid are at risk of finding out that they do not have insurance if they needed to claim. Meanwhile, drivers who have taken out motoring policies through ghost brokers are driving illegally. Drivers caught by the police, whose policy is fraudulent or has been cancelled without their knowledge, risk a fixed penalty of ¬£300 and six penalty points on their licence. If the case goes to court a driver can face an unlimited fine and be disqualified from driving.

Nandan explains how more people are brought into the financial system. A decade back only few citizens had access to a bank account and personalized identity document.But after introduction of Aadhaar card more people have access to bank accounts and are also availing other benefits.Then Nandan talks about how people are encouraged to be engaged throughout the process. With the rise of online money transactions the UPI become a popular and trusted application for such processes. Also the new infrastructure, account aggregator platform ensures data to all businesses without compromising on privacy. In this way consumers are empowered with data unlike other westerns systems. In upcoming years this platform is expected to grow hugely transforming the entire nation.

The application will allow LV= GI car insurance customers to ask questions about their policy using their home assistants. The new voice skill will be the first of its kind within the general insurance industry and will initially be able to answer over 500 policy-based questions, which have been collated from commonly asked questions on LiveChat and the call centre. To ensure the app works as effectively as possible, LV= GI will also be receiving constant updates to help add or refine answers, and update the software when required.

The alternative method of delivering policy information has been developed to help those less able to use a computer or telephone to check their documents. It is also hoped that the application will reduce some of the more than 28,000 questions on policy documents that are received by call centre employees every month, freeing up time for more in-depth call handling or claims.

I was going to watch my daughter receive an award at her school assembly. Why? Because I'm human. I'm not trying to impress people how hard I work. I prefer to build an open and transparent culture.

Sudo is a tool that provides a specified user permissions above their normal levels, including root (administrative) access, but by leveraging this security flaw, it‚Äôs possible a low-privileged user (or malware) could get unauthorized root access, and thus potentially wreak all sorts of havoc on the host system.

An Apple security expert, Joe Vennix, discovered the bug, and it‚Äôs not the first he has pinned down. Back in October 2019, Vennix drew attention to another Sudo flaw that potentially allowed any user to run commands as root.

U.S. consumers aren‚Äôt adopting voice-based shopping as quickly as expected, according to a new report today from eMarketer. While consumers have been happy to bring smart speakers into their home, they continue to use them more often for simple commands ‚Äî like playing music or getting information, for example ‚Äî not for making purchases. However, the overall number of voice shoppers is growing. It‚Äôs just slower than previously forecast, the analysts explain.

By the end of this year, eMarketer estimates that 21.6 million people will have made a purchase using their smart speaker. That‚Äôs lower than the Q2 2019 forecast, which expected the number to reach 23.6 million.

U.S. companies are eyeing cyber insurance because they have potentially millions of dollars at stake under the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect Jan. 1. That‚Äôs because state residents can seek up to $750 per consumer, per data security incident under the law, which also directs the state‚Äôs attorney general to take enforcement actions for privacy violations.

Large companies that handle personal information, including Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and Amazon Inc., have millions of customers in the state, placing them at risk for large settlements or expensive jury trials in the event of a data-security incident. Such businesses are likely to see the bulk of consumer-privacy demands, opening them up to possible enforcement for alleged CCPA violations.

In today‚Äôs tight job market, business leaders spend a lot of time worrying about how to hire and retain great employees. But a new report suggests they‚Äôre strangely inattentive to the very changes that could go a long way toward solving the problem.

A new Conference Board survey (pdf) of 1,520 executives, including 740 CEOs, confirms that, globally, the chief concern of CEOs is attracting top talent and keeping their best performers on board. ‚ÄúDemand for highly talented employees now exceeds supply in most mature economies and, as a result, job openings are more difficult to fill,‚Äù the Conference Board notes. Indeed, competition for talent was the top stressor for CEOs in the US, Europe, Latin America, and China. (Only Japan had a different top concern: developing ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù leaders.)

Web shells are crucial because of their functions. For non-technical  readers that have not encountered the term until today, a *"web shell" refers to a malicious program or script that's installed on a hacked server.*

They provide a visual interface that hackers can use to interact with the hacked server and its filesystem. Most web shell contain basic functions to rename, copy, move, and even edit or upload new files on a server. They can also be used to change file and directory permissions, or archive and download (steal) data from the server.

"Regulating here is not the preferred option but it is a fallback option if we don't see the required change," he said after a speech in Sydney.

Global card schemes MasterCard and Visa, alongside the major four banks, dominate card payments systems in Australia. EFTPOS is owned by domestic financial institutions and retailers.

*Government executives on AI: Surveying how the public sector is approaching an AI-enabled future*

AI is not completely new to the public sector. The first AI contract was awarded in 1985 by the US Social Security Administration but the technology still wasn‚Äôt advanced enough to become common inthe following decades. Now, the growing ubiquity of digital technologies, advances in the ability tostore and analyze massive amounts of data, and exponential growth in processing power seem tofinally be fast-tracking AI into the mainstream. This growing usage is reflected in the AI initiatives being undertaken by public sector organizations across levels. For instance, in February 2019, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create the American AI Initiative, which aims to prioritize and guide AI development in the United States. This builds on other federal AI initiatives,such as the Select Committee on AI.
 At the statelevel, the government of New Jersey has set up an innovation training platform to educate 
government workers about new technologies such as AI and blockchain.

2/7/20, 13:07 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Technology_: *Google has released a tool to spot faked and doctored images*

How it works: Assembler combines several existing techniques in academia for detecting common manipulation techniques, including changing image brightness and pasting copied pixels elsewhere to cover up something while retaining the same visual texture. It also includes a detector that spots deepfakes of the type created using StyleGAN, an algorithm that can generate realistic imaginary faces. These detection techniques feed into a master model that tells users how likely it is that an image has been manipulated. 

Why it matters: Fake images are among the harder things to verify, especially with the rise of manipulation by artificial intelligence. The window of opportunity for journalists and fact-checkers to react is also rapidly shrinking, as disinformation spreads at speed and scale.

*The Top 3 Most Punctual Airlines in the World : OAG's Punctuality League 2020 Report*

No. 1
Garuda Indonesia (95.01%)

No.2 
Copa Airlines (92.01%)

No.3
Skymark Airlines (90.12%)

*Ranking from 4-10 as follows:*

4. Hawaiian Airlines (87.40%)

5. LATAM Airlines Group (86.41%)

6. Aeroflot (86.30%)

7. All Nippon Airways (85.92%)

8. Jetstar Asia (85.48%)

9. Singapore Airlines (85.32%)

10. Thai AirAsia (84.49%)

_*(Figures in the parenthesis represent the punctuality index of the respective airlines)*_

Garuda Indonesia, with a 95% punctuality index, is a star player in the sector but it has had its share of turbulence from when it was banned in the EU because of crashes, pilot errors and lack of training and was declared "really unsafe". It has over taken a Quantum Leap since 2009 after EU lifted the ban and it has been performing with flying colours ever since.

It is clear that our regulatory system needs an update. If we try to regulate 21st century technology and beyond with 20th century tools, we‚Äôll get none of the benefits of regulation and all of the downsides.

The days of third-party data tracking within the world‚Äôs most popular browser are over.

After months of speculation, Google has finally confirmed that it will join Safari and Firefox in withdrawing support for third-party cookies by 2022.

The growth of the ad tech ecosystem as we know it was due in large part to advertisers‚Äô ability to use third-party products to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù customers around the web, understanding their behaviors and preferences, and then serve targeted advertising to them efficiently via digital media. As the major browsers (and consumers themselves, via ad-blockers) eliminate the ability to ‚Äútag‚Äù consumers, the industry can expect a sharp departure from the way things were.

https://bit.ly/39jIjn6
2/10/20, 15:25 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: There is more to this story. Google seems to have been upto something using a new piece of info called x-client-data which the Chrome browser makes available to Google services (like Gmail, Youtube etc). This means that Google can potentially keep tracking users exactly as it has been doing all along while the rest of the world will not be able to once third-party cookies stop. Depending on who you ask, this is seen as a sneaky, but not very damaging, move by Google all the way to downright shady.

OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANK
I recently spoke to First National Horse and Buggy about their innovation efforts. Here are two innovative ways the company is planning to improve their customers‚Äô:

Convenience. As they age, people find it harder to climb the stairs to get into a buggy. So FNHB will be deploying mini-escalators attached to the side of the buggy to make it easier for customers to get in.
Security. Customers were reporting that bad actors were stealing buggies at night, using them to go places, then returning them before daybreak. So FNHB is installing combination locks on the buggies‚Äô wheels. If you don‚Äôt know the combination to the lock, you can‚Äôt use the buggy!

Brexit uncertainty and the weakened pound has also hiked the cost of vehicle repair claims thanks to the price of imported parts rising. 

Lee Griffin, chief executive and a founder of GoCompare, said: 'We're expecting this year to be another challenging one for car insurers, with a perfect storm of factors coming together to put further pressure on premiums.

Varo Money is poised to become a full-fledged bank, making it the first of a new wave of fintech upstarts to win that approval in the US. The company‚Äôs long and expensive journey through a thick barrier of regulation is a reason why America‚Äôs banks have repelled the tech disruption sweeping through other industries.

The five-year-old mobile bank got approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to receive deposit insurance, according to a statement yesterday. That brings the San Francisco-based company a step closer to a national banking charter, which will allow it to hold deposits itself instead of relying on a partner, to make loans in all 50 US states, and to offer credit cards.

Are  *regulators or founders or investor* copying what is getting implemented in  Singapore UK HK and other markets.




Invite views of community members which will be covered in the *bespoke* reports
https://www.fiaks.com/fiaks-bespoke/
2/12/20, 19:19 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: The term ‚ÄúNeobanks‚Äù has now become a broad clubbing of everything that‚Äôs not a scheduled bank. However it‚Äôs important to understand how different ‚Äúneobanks‚Äù are making unique benefits available to customers though unfortunately most of them end up copying each other. 

European neobanks are the most further ahead driven primarily by progressive legislation in Europe while America has lagged behind precisely for this reason. 

Payment banks have not fulfilled their promise and newer though process is required that can meet customer needs. 

For example, why can‚Äôt a company issue expense cards to all its employees through its bank and control who can spend how much and on what. Sure, other players are doing this today but it means I need a third party service to provide what my bank doesn‚Äôt. 

Why does my accountant not get access to my bank statements directly without being a signatory to my bank account ? 

Why can I not make direct ach payments to other countries and have to resort to archaic wire transfers which is well past its sell by date?

The only thing payment bank did was to allow banking without sizing you based on how much float you‚Äôd maintain with the bank. Nothing else really changed. 

Banks or even payment banks can of course do all of these but they don‚Äôt. Focus on customer experience is extremely critical. That‚Äôs why neobanks. (Or course there are many more reasons I‚Äôve just listed a few). 

Perhaps some banks offer a watered down version of some of the above conveniences but that does not make the grade when it‚Äôs a question of meeting (or exceeding) customer expectations.
2/12/20, 19:22 - +91 90233 89243: Payment banks were operating as a normal bank, i.e. they had to take a banking licences and had a deposit limit. Neo banks ( As its termed) , they are not banks in my opinion , but they are using technology to reach to the end consumers by aggregating various financial services, that's what is intuitive and is garnering support across countries.
2/12/20, 19:22 - Vikas Business Phone: Wow!!! Thank you for FIAKS PATHFINDER AWARD winner Mr   Sandeep.. Proud of you Sir üôèüèª
2/12/20, 19:29 - Vikas Business Phone: Agree it's not launched... But will happen soon. As we are copycats 

My question is which of these products and services can't be done by Payments bank??
 Lending they can partner with SFB and do it.. Right ?
2/12/20, 19:40 - +91 90233 89243: can payment banks do it ? yes. Can banks do it , yes. are they doing it , no.  However, the major use cases of neo banks are more into personal finance management like aggregation of accounts,  cards , investments, loans ,insurances , wealth managment etc.  as per my thinking for a bank this seems to be an overkill and can shift focus from their core biz.
2/12/20, 19:41 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
2/12/20, 19:48 - Vikas Business Phone: _Several responses pouring in. Will share couple of them_

*FIAKS Maven, award winner and thought leader on Why NEO Bank Or Virtual Bank should be considered*

_He says_
The term ‚ÄúNeobanks‚Äù has now become a broad clubbing of everything that‚Äôs not a scheduled bank. However it‚Äôs important to understand how different ‚Äúneobanks‚Äù are making unique benefits available to customers though unfortunately most of them end up copying each other. 

European neobanks are the most further ahead driven primarily by progressive legislation in Europe while America has lagged behind precisely for this reason. 

*Payment banks have not fulfilled their promise* and newer though process is required that can meet customer needs. 

For example, why can‚Äôt a company issue *expense cards to all its employees through its bank and control who can spend how much and on what. Sure, other players are doing this today but it means I need a third party service to provide what my bank doesn‚Äôt. 

Why does my accountant not get access to my bank statements directly without being a signatory to my bank account ? 

Why can I not make direct ACH payments to other countries and have to resort to archaic wire transfers which is well past its sell by date?

The only thing payment bank did was to allow banking without sizing you based on how much float you‚Äôd maintain with the bank. Nothing else really changed. 

Banks or even payment banks can of course do all of these but they don‚Äôt. Focus on customer experience is extremely critical. That‚Äôs why neobanks. (Or course there are many more reasons I‚Äôve just listed a few). 

Perhaps some banks offer a watered down version of some of the above conveniences but that does not make the grade when it‚Äôs a question of meeting (or exceeding) customer expectations.
2/12/20, 20:23 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community is asking* which product or service can't be done by *Payments bank(PB)* that regulator may consider issuing  another licensing guidelines for NEO BANK or VIRTUAL BANK in India?PB can even do lending  by  partnering with SFB..... Right?or Is it another attempt to blow the investor money or it has a merit

*View 22* _*Why Neo bank is Better compared to payment bank*_ 

Am saying ease of Technology usage is low with regular bank including PB...
Simple example... today I want start a RD with regular a Neo bank for trip I plan to go in 9 months time... I have configuration option where I can say every time I spend money on Swiggy/ Zomato, trf % or fixed amount next zero amount to the RD( saving goal) account.. so if I transact 5 time days, each time I ll ve a credit to RD account... will a PB give this option??
Giving you a numerical example.
Saving Goal: 25k
RD: opened
Configuration option: 1) Every transaction I do say Rs 245 is the bill amount, so trf 5 rupees to RD, this transaction will done post payment of 245. 
2) bill amount: 250, trf 5 % of txn amount to RD. So RD a/c gets credit of 12.5 rupees. 
I can do this as customer any number of times.

Banks have cost of txn count which they ve to pay to CBS company like Infosys or tcs or temenos... which is not a problem with Neo bank.

*Question* They are not using core banking platform ?And still offering banking services

*Response*
They built there own...

As a Neo bank, they opt for bin sponsorship and savings account as a feature which is taken from bank.
When I open a RD, a sub account is created under the main saving account with no limit of no of txns .
2/12/20, 21:35 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS community member highlight regulatory blunder in framing *payments bank* guidlines. He say I have  doubt that *NEO Bank or Virtual Bank* license if issued in future  will be another blunder in making. They will have NO  takers in the market whenever it get issued.. People are very very sceptical today to take even SMALL FINANCE BANKING license on tap_. Regulators are driving the agenda of imposing fines on banks. Auditors are working with single agenda of how can they make life of the banks miserable during routine audits.

*View 35*

_He says_ 
Payments Bank are *not yet allowed products like RD*. Can route it to another bank though.
Deposit beyond 1 L gets converted into an FD with a partner bank


*View 42*
Neo banks require much freedom to be successful. They are not regulated yet... Payment banks can act as Business Correspondent for any bank and can source lending accounts. 
Payment bank may not have cost and tech leverage which the Neo banks have due to their existence at other geographies...The outsourcing guidelines in India is too regulated and does not provide flexibility for the success of Neo banks ...

For decades, employers embraced workplace wellness as a way to lower their healthcare costs. But, despite spending billions on programs annually, research shows that workplace wellness has not lowered insurance premiums.

Nonetheless, before we relegate workplace wellness to a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù discretionary benefit, we need to understand, first, why it was a mistake to expect employee wellness to deliver ROI through lower healthcare costs. 

And more importantly, employers need to reset strategies so that workplace wellness (or, well-being) can deliver on its promise of even more substantial ROI than the long-elusive goal of lowering insurance premiums.

2/13/20, 18:58 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _CEOs_: *Women CEOs negotiate better severance than men ‚Äî for all the wrong reasons*

According to a recent study, female CEOs are 45 per cent more likely to be fired than their male counterparts. Previous research has shown that a man‚Äôs competence is often assumed in leadership roles while a woman‚Äôs competence is generally questioned. And female CEOs are more likely to be blamed when their organizations struggle, and are much more likely to be targeted by activist investors.

Rougher road
Female CEOs face a tougher road than male CEOs and they know it. You can see this play out when corporate boards try to recruit for the executive suite. Research I conducted with Felice Klein (Boise State University) and Cynthia Devers (Texas A&M University) examined whether pre-employment severance agreements reflect the heightened concern of prospective female CEOs that they are more vulnerable to being dismissed.

2/17/20, 10:11 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member is asking why is senior management team member selling  his stocks before retirement*

Isn't  it creating a doubt on efforts put in on the succession planning within the bank?

Or  Is the organization over dependent on few top leaders? 

Shouldn't these officials be banned from selling it's stocks one year before and one year after leaving the organization

Please opine
2/17/20, 10:33 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member says* 

*View 2*
No such ban required.

*View 4*
Too much regulations is not good for the country 


*View 7*
These are vested shares. They should be allowed to sell. Property purchase could be one reason





_Will cover the rest of the views in the FIAKS bespoke report_
2/17/20, 10:45 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community members on Sale of share by CEO who is going to retire*

*View 15* CXO 
All questions raised are *valid* but banning sale of stocks for a year before and after will not be of much help. The reality is most successful organisations are run by top 2 or max 3 people

*View 13* CXO
Agree that there should be no restrictions on sales. It is vested and there cannot be any rule (unless until it is a fresh IPO)

*Views 12* CXO


Why ban, they have rightfully earned by working hard. 

They might also have different objective to full fill by selling. 

As per regulations they have to declare and that's good enough. If people who have bought stocks by considering founders holding than they should sell and exit it that was the objective.
2/17/20, 10:47 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: These are vested shares, he should be allowed respecting  his  contribution to the bank.
2/17/20, 11:00 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community on sale of shares by CEO who is going to retire says*  Anonymous 

This is a standard practice in most banks. Senior management sells shares held in their own name either to their own family or to a investment company held by them. This allows them to trade freely without failing compliance norms.

Also many a times they sell and buy other stocks since trading in their own company shares is prohibited by insider trading norms.

Specifically in this case it could also be  considering his retirement the following reasons :

1) Estate Planning 
2) Investing in a new venture 
3) Just buying assets towards retirement 

Also If u see the pattern - typically upon vesting all the top  5-10 guys sell immediately.

Their holding is very low compared to the rest of the staff as compared to their net worth. There are very strict insider trading norms. They want liquidity without someone watching over them.
2/17/20, 11:03 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: There are insider trading regulations. On top of it, organizations have their own guidelines on trading of shares. If it is within those norms it should be just fine and not subject to unnecessary public scrutiny
2/17/20, 11:27 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Impact Of Ban On Use Of Agents To Chase Loans?*

Business Correspondence as a concept was pushed by RBI with the objective of financial inclusion as a last-mile reach. Over a period, a lot of business correspondence companies have mastered the art of asset sourcing and collection using their own processes but booking it in bank books. This notification seems like a sudden shift from that thinking and will impact financial inclusion especially on the asset side. This will result in an impact on the Priority Sector Lending achievement of the banks as well. The same business will become costly for banks.
http://bit.ly/2wiewwN
2/17/20, 11:34 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Management selling their shares is their prerogative. There are a few cases where there needs to be oversight - mostly to do with insider trading - but other than that there are reasons for any restriction. Your questions about doubt on succession planning and over dependency are valid - but then these are absolutely the questions which the market is well placed to vote with their wallets on.

The letter, sent in January, tells fintech firms that they must sign onto a "concrete plan" by July to move from methods such as screenscraping and using customer passwords to a new data collection method, says Reuters, citing sources.

The bank says that these methods are not secure and wants third parties to connect to an API that gives access to limited account data, decided by customers.

If firms do not agree, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the customer data, which is the lifeblood for many fintech firms and the data aggregators which serve them. Most firms have already agreed to JPMorgan's demands, says Reuters.

Health data paints a rich picture of our lives. Even if you remove your name, date of birth and NHS number to ‚Äúanonymise‚Äù yourself, a full health history will reveal your age, gender, the places where you have lived, your family relationships and aspects of your lifestyle.

Used in combination with other available information, this may be enough to verify that this medical history relates to you personally and to target you online. Consequently, whenever the NHS shares health data, even if it is anonymised, we need to have confidence in who it goes to and what they can do with it.

Procurement organisations today are facing increasing complexity on all fronts.This complexity has only increased challenges for chief procurement officers (CPOs), who, in addition to delivering sourcing-centric cost savings, are also expected to enhance their influence with C-level peers and extend their business impact into strategic areas such as risk management, corporate development, and innovation. Yet more often than not, CPOs are asked to do all of this with fewer resources and thinner budgets.

Member says he attended an EXPO at Greater Noida which was on Payment Systems Technology. Out of say 500 stalls in the exhibition, with no exaggeration, 490 were Chinese right from the microchips to even electronic cars and solar panels.He exclaimed that he has never been ashamed so much in his life!‚Äô

How will innovation happen with hardly any support to start-ups? The majority of start-up initiatives in India are nexus between bankers and PE/VC companies. If we check out how many bankers are working with bootstrap ventures - it's practically NIL.
Why isn‚Äôt regulator questioning/auditing the bank on startup programs that they are running? Most of the bankers are flying to _Singapore,US_ under the name of start-up initiative promoting companies registered in these markets started by Indian entrepreneurs. Banks are just working with the same set of entrepreneurs creating an entry barrier for the new bootstrap start-ups. Isn‚Äôt supporting start-ups their responsibility?

He says 

very true and this was my comment at the Cards Expo also. you go to any payment / banking / digital event. the systems there are far from any iota of a digital environment. take for example - 

1) the food court : we still have paper coupons being given out, you buy them at a counter and go order your food. 

2) entry tickets : why do you need to get your pass at the registration counter and then have a manual validation at the entrance. can't we make it 100% digital - from online booking / payments and then selected entrances at the venues ? don't put turnstiles, but can have RFID entrances for validation of the RFID cards 

3) digital wallets : never included in the ticket. Recent BKC event  was the same.... so why are we talking digital in India. 

Its only on paper / VC funded and for talk shows / presentations. Ground reality is far away from what the event is all about

The bank issued an update to directive 375-P, which lists all signs of suspicious activity that may be linked to money laundering. This is the first such update since 2012, when the initial regulations were introduced.

The manual was developed in collaboration with the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). A central bank representative explained that this was done to ‚Äúadd new schemes of conducting unusual operations, with consideration to the modern developments in financial markets.‚Äù

They sent a DMCA takedown letter to Google to remove a whole bunch of pre-existing content on the web. It included many links which Zee claimed infringes on their copyright of "DID". So they asked Google to take down several articles which used "Did" in their title and, hilariously, dictionaries which had the word "did" in it üôÇ Looks like bots not only generate spam, they now send take down notices on their own with no human intervention or review!

IKEA is now letting customers pay for goods with their time. Yes, that's right: the more time customers spend travelling to IKEA, the more they can buy. Because beginning from this month, IKEA Dubai is running a campaign that will allow customers to spend their time as a currency, simply by showing IKEA checkout staff their Google Maps timeline, which proves how much time they've spent travelling to IKEA stores.

2/18/20, 19:23 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Online_: *What happens to our online lives after we die?*
Over the course of the next few decades, there will be more and more dead people on Facebook. In fact, according to some estimates, as early as 2060 the number of deceased users‚Äô accounts will exceed the number of accounts with a living person behind them.

But people‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital afterlives‚Äù extend far beyond Facebook. When a 21st century citizen dies, they often leave behind a trove of posts, private messages, and personal information on everything from Twitter to online bank records. Who owns this data, and whose responsibility is it to protect the privacy of the deceased? Faheem Hussain, a social scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, has spent the past few years peering into the murky waters of how people, platforms, and governments manage the digital lives we leave behind.

As salaried guy I also should have problem of organisation deducting tax from my salary payout ? Isn‚Äôt it ? Or are we missing some thing here 

Invite views of the community members in understanding the concern .
2/19/20, 11:05 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community views on 1% TDS on e-commerce*

*View 6*
This provision will not apply in cases where the seller‚Äôs gross amount of sales during the previous year through the e-commerce operator is less than Rs 5 lakh and has furnished his PAN or Aadhaar number.

This takes care of micro enterprise.

*View 8*
Let me take an example here...
Amazon and Flipkart claim to have more than a million sellers in India.Only few thousands (about 22000) file IT return).

The government in its bid to increase tax net base, have introduced TDS to be deducted by eCommerce platform and  if seller wants a refund then he will be required to file ITR.

*This is smart move to tap Tax evasion by sellers*.
2/19/20, 11:09 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: It does look like a good move. I am unsure how things like returned products (which is a significant number) will get handled.

2/19/20, 17:11 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Artificial intelligence_: *Algorithms might be better than us at predicting whether people will reoffend*

The research: Researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley tried to recreate a 2018 experiment which found that humans with no training were just as good as a widely-used risk-assessment software program called COMPAS. Risk-assessment algorithms are trained on historical defendant data and are supposed to help judges determine whether a defendant should be kept in jail or be allowed out while awaiting trial. (We went into some of the problems with them in this interactive piece last year.)

Test the humans: The team used a dataset of COMPAS risk assessments covering about 7,000 real defendants and used it to create profiles for each one. These profiles were showed to 400 laypeople recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk, asking them to decide if they thought the person would commit another crime. The 2018 study found COMPAS was accurate about 65% of the time, and humans were closer to 67%. This new study managed to closely replicate these results.

Since 2010, 121 rural hospitals have closed. The National Rural Health Association says more than one-third of all rural U.S. hospitals are at serious risk of shutting down.

The decision by some states not to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act could be a big reason for many of the closures, according to the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute. Hospital consolidation, demographics and a drop in demand for inpatient services are other factors, according to one analyst.

But it‚Äôs not just rural hospitals that are going out of business.

*Real Time Payment systems & third party access*

There are multiple models for expanding the adoption and usage of digital payment 
solutions in a country, from card networks in the developed world to closed loop stored value 
wallets and Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems that facilitate bank account to bank account transactions at relatively low cost. 
In this report, we‚Äôll focus on RTP systems. More than 50 countries have rolled them out, with 
many more in the works. RTP systems are the rails for modern payment infrastructures, offering 
near-instant transactions with a minimum of friction for all parties. They fundamentally change 
how payments are made and the ways in which they can become embedded in the new digital 
economy.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, the Commission is trying to draw a distinction between low-risk and high-risk use cases. Where the risk to people‚Äôs fundamental rights is low, regulation should be light-touch. Here, the Commission is talking about voluntary schemes to let companies label their A.I. applications as safe. But where the risk is high, such as in health or policing applications, regulation will be extremely tight.

In these high-risk cases, there will have to be human oversight, the Commission said. *And that means giving regulators the ability to inspect what is going on inside the black box*. ‚ÄúAuthorities should be able to test and certify the data used by algorithms as they check cosmetics, cars or toys,‚Äù the Commission said.

In the ‚ÄúAkamai 2020 State of the Internet Security‚Äù report, the company said up to 75% of all credential abuse attacks against the financial services industry targeted APIs directly.

In API targeting, Akamai said in an email, criminals use bots and tools that allow threading, or multiple simultaneous connections, to attempt multiple logins at once. By targeting the APIs, they hope to avoid some front-end defenses and speed up their validation times.

He says 

When we evaluate the contribution and hopefully not demise of wallets, I would like to highlight that wallets serve two purposes - 

a) innovation & convenience for customers 

and

b)  protection for customers 

Banks in the absence of wallets would never have done the first and to that extent we owe it to wallet companies and leaders to bring constant product innovation in the market 

Esp in india, even the RTP flow was not initiated by banks but by non banks 

On protection - the risk To customer on RTP is far higher than in wallets and with repeated gaps on the  bank side and low accountability, wallets can cover that risk

Barclays said axing the tracking system was a response to "colleague feedback", but would not say if it was permanent.

*This was expected and is right approach to stop merchant acquiring bank from bleeding per transaction. This is related to those merchants with higher than Rs 50 Crore Turn Over where government has made MDR zero for UPI and Rupay card. If Merchant acquiring bank is not charging Merchant, it is logical for keeping both interchange and PSP fee zero, otherwise Merchant Acquiring bank will have negative income for each UPI & RuPay transactions for such merchants*

FIAKS community *_Thought Leaders_* who are Former CXO bankers from HDFC Bank & Standard Chartered Bank share the *forecast on the Tax Change Impact* 

*Post* - Bajaj group announces Dividend to beat the tax change.Record date is 4th March (Per share):
- Bajaj Auto: Rs 120
- Bajaj Finserve: Rs 5
- Bajaj Finance: Rs 10
- Bajaj Holding: Rs 40
- Maharst Scooter: Rs 50
As expected all cash rich group will start the waterfall of dividends...Bajaj auto used to give Rs 60 dividend since couple of years and now it‚Äôs double

*Question* _How tax change is forcing companies to give such dividend_

*Response*
*_Tax to be charged at receivers Tax Rate. All companies with high promoter holding will clear out their reserves before March 31. Currently dividend will be taxed at 10%. In the next year tax will be chargeable in the hands of the recipients which is likely to be 30%. For promoters 45%++_*

2/22/20, 19:20 - Vikas Business Phone: *KNOWLEDGE SPEAKS*: *FIAKS community Thought Leader on DDT & No Tax leakage* 

Prior to June 1997, dividends were taxed in the hands of shareholders, like any other income. However, for ease of administration and collection of tax at a single point, taxation of dividend was shifted from shareholders to companies distributing dividends, with such dividends being exempt from tax in the hands of shareholders.

Taxation of dividends at the shareholder level has made investment in jurisdictions like Mauritius and Hong Kong attractive, with tax treaties providing a beneficial tax rate of 5 per cent on dividends. However, having substance in these jurisdictions continues to govern the availability of treaty benefits.

Also, under the DDT regime, pooling investment vehicles like mutual funds used to suffer dual-level taxation:

1. DDT paid by the company distributing dividends to mutual funds; and 

2. DDT payable by mutual funds on distribution to unit-holders. 

While, under the proposed regime, there will be single-tier taxation in the hands of unit-holders. 

There is no tax leakage on distribution of dividend by the company to mutual funds.

===========================
FAB Queries  *What is DDT??*

*DDT mean Dividend Distribution Tax* 
Jargons made easy by FIAKS


_*FAB* stands for *FIAKS Ayla Bhaat*. ie When you write the below  sentence in HiMinglish (Hindi-Marathi-English)_
"FIAKS ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§Ü‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§"
2/23/20, 00:14 - Vikas Business Phone: *KNOWLEDGE SPEAKS*: *FIAKS community Thought Leader on DDT*

He Adds...Minority retail investors will benefit from this change, it will also lead to several unintentional anomalies. 

Indian promoters and *high net-worth individuals (HNIs) will face a significant increase in the overall tax incidence to 57%* (versus 47% in FY20) on dividend income.

Let assume,
‚ñ™Ô∏èProfit Before Tax (PBT) of a company is Rs. 100
‚ñ™Ô∏èCorporate tax is 25% including surcharge i.e. Rs. 25
‚ñ™Ô∏èProfit after tax (PAT) Rs. 75 i.e. available profit for distribution as dividend.
‚ñ™Ô∏èTax in the hands of HNIs Promoters is 43% _including surcharges & cess_
‚ñ™Ô∏èTax paid by individual is Rs. 32(75x 43%)
‚ñ™Ô∏èTotal tax on promoters' is Rs. 25+32 = Rs. 57.
*This change also brings in a disparity between Indian and MNC promoters with respect to the tax rates on dividend income* 
‚ñ™Indian promoters will be liable to pay tax at 43%.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCorporate foreign promoters will be charged 22%, or even lower (5% in some cases) if they are located in a country where the tax treaty provides beneficial rates.
*This provision needs to be rethought & discussed.*

Moreover, the creation of significant tax arbitrage is also a very likely possibility (in the hands of the recipient) between the two popular ways in which a company returns money to its shareholder
a. dividend
b. share buyback. 

Buybacks will be taxed at 23%, 
while Dividend income will be taxed in the hands of promoters or HNIs at an effective rate of 43%. 

So as an investor or promoter what do you prefer?

*So many companies may prefer buybacks over dividends to distribute profits. Many companies may, in fact, curtail dividends*.

Category III alternative investment funds (AIF) set up as a trust will be at a major disadvantage compared to Category I/II AIFs. This is because Category III AIFs do not have the pass-through status and will be taxed at a maximum marginal rate of 43%. 

Similarly, unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) may lose attractiveness compared to mutual funds as insurance companies are liable to pay tax on dividend income at 12%, while mutual funds enjoy specific exemption (under Section 10 (23d)) on such income.

City based Indian Bank has decided to load more of 200 rupee notes and stop loading and dispensation of Rs2,000 notes in its ATMs as a customer friendly move, a senior official told IANS on Saturday.

" *After withdrawing cash from ATMs customers come into the bank branches to exchange Rs2,000 notes for smaller denomination currency notes. In order to avoid that we have decided to stop loading of Rs2,000 denomination notes in ATMs with immediate effect*," the Indian Bank official said.

Chatbots do not help with customer retention. They only address the specific customer queries which may or may not be satisfactory but on the other hand, human executives do play some part in customer retention in the context of emotions. For complex businesses, it is not feasible to program all possible scenarios for a chatbot and also it would be a time-consuming task.

The first time most people ever heard of OpenAI was on February 14, 2019. That day, the lab announced impressive new research: a model that could generate convincing essays and articles at the push of a button. Feed it a sentence from The Lord of the Rings or the start of a (fake) news story about Miley Cyrus shoplifting, and it would spit out paragraph after paragraph of text in the same vein.

But there was also a catch: the model, called GPT-2, was too dangerous to release, the researchers said. If such powerful technology fell into the wrong hands, it could easily be weaponized to produce disinformation at immense scale.

Motorists receive the best value car insurance if they renew this month ‚Äì paying almost ¬£100 less than if they were to renew two months earlier, according to Compare The Market.

The price comparison website has discovered that premiums are on average ¬£37 a year cheaper in February than in a typical month.

A key reason is that February is the busiest month for renewals, with prices lower in a competitive market fighting it out for the custom of 20 million car owners.

2/24/20, 18:52 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _corporate boards_: 
*Warren Buffett just explained the problem with today‚Äôs corporate boards*

First, the legendary investor addressed the dearth of women. When he started out, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she ‚Äúrepresented family controlling the enterprise.‚Äù Today, not much has changed‚Äîwomen having a voice in the boardroom continues to be a ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù This comes after Goldman Sachs announced last month that it won‚Äôt take companies public unless they have at least one ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù member on the board.

Another problem is that directors are more likely to go along with management teams than to challenge them‚Äîand CEOs are more likely to look for a ‚Äúcocker spaniel‚Äù than ‚Äúpit bulls‚Äù for the board. Having served as a director of 21 publicly owned companies (including Berkshire, Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and Gillette), Buffett has yet to see a CEO who craves an acquisition bring in a board member who is against it‚Äîincluding himself. In other words, the arrangement is almost always in favor of the CEO looking to make the acquisition. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask the barber whether you need a haircut,‚Äù he suggested.

1. Change the conversation

‚ÄúWe need to help people understand that working for the same company in the long term, right up to the age of 65, no longer makes sense‚Ä¶.We must change our approach and be very flexible, because all this transformation will erase many traditional views that we have about labor relations.‚Äù

2. Focus on your existing workforce

‚ÄúI saw an interview with the Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, where he was asked, ‚ÄòWhere do you get these techies from?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòI hired the people you fired.‚Äô And this can be done. If somebody gives employees the capability to reinvent themselves, gives them some training, they will do it. That‚Äôs what we found. We hired some new people but we reskilled our old people and built this whole cadre to re-architect our internal technology.‚Äù

Cybersecurity researchers at Zscaler analysed data generated by IoT devices generated by enterprises and found there has been a surge in unauthorised IoT traffic from devices connected to the network by employees. Staff connect the likes of smart watches, fitness trackers to their enterprise network to make things simpler but these could in turn undermine the security of business networks.

The top unauthorized IoT devices Zscaler observed include digital home assistants, TV set-top boxes, IP cameras, smart home devices, smart TVs, smart watches, and even automotive multimedia systems.

The possible case is biometric print taken on some skimming device when the customer has gone for cash withdrawal at CSP location using biometric scan. Keep in mind that AEPS is possible with simple Android mobile and a USB fingerprint scanner with 2G/3G/4G data. Once this is copied and stored, the fraudster would need Aadhaar and name of the bank, which is not known to third party even in transaction slips for security reasons. *The bank account details and Aadhaar copies collected by fraudster would enable this info also known*.

The flaw, discovered by the cybersecurity firm ESET, effectively disarms the encryption used by a password-protected Wi-Fi network. This could let hackers watch the activity on the network as if it were wide open. But while this could mean victims are vulnerable to eavesdropping, software updates and other layers of security will likely prevent this attack from having catastrophic results.

Wh00ps: The vulnerability, dubbed Kr00k by researchers, affects devices with Wi-Fi chips by Broadcom and Cypress‚Äîused in a vast range of devices with wireless internet, including Apple, Google, and Samsung phones. But security updates have already been deployed to fix the issue, so the best advice is to make sure your computers, phones, and all internet-connected devices have the latest software and firmware.

The banking industry collectively made $233.1 billion in profits in 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Tuesday, the industry's second-most profitable year ever.

The slight drop in profits from 2018 is due to the drop in interest rates, which happened in the second half of last year. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate three times, in an effort to shore up the U.S. economy, which was facing difficulties from the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing manufacturing sector.

*The doughnut system : Shifting focus from growth to thriving*

While the 21st century polarizes everything from wealth to ideology, we are gradually becoming aware of a ceiling: the plane that takes off must eventually land. 

The principle of growth seems to work only till the glass is filled to the brim. For a healthy and sustainable economy, we need to rein in our dependency on growth and instead, focus on thriving.

2/28/20, 11:44 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Tax havens_:
*Tax havens cost governments $200 billion a year. It‚Äôs time to change the way global tax works* 

About 40% of multinational profits or $650 billion are shifted each to such tax havens by multinational firms from all countries. The price tag on this type of behavior? $200 Bn. lost in global tax revenue. The reason that this behavior is possible is an antiquated tax code designed in the 1920‚Äôs. The solution will be a global overhaul of the corporate tax code: and this overhaul might not be that far away. In this article I investigate the question: What would a fair, functional global tax system look like in 2030 and how bleak is the alternative?

First things first: How is it that companies can use tax havens to avoid paying taxes all together? The answer lies in the current international tax code that treats a multinational firm not as one firm, but as a collection of national entities. For today‚Äôs global companies, each dollar of reported income in the US or Germany will be taxed at close to 30%, whereas income reported in Bermuda will be taxed at 0%. Tax minimizing strategies that shift profits to various low-tax regimes have been documented at major multinationals including Amazon, Google, IKEA, Nike and many others.

Greetings!
Today's quest is provided by FIAKS Maven and FIAKS Intellectual Award Winner 2019

*Question: Which is the MNC whose performance index is shown in green?*

_Kindly try to give the complete response. We will share the final answer of this quiz by 6pm IST_
2/28/20, 15:26 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 1*

It is a very well known company but is neither a bank nor a fintech
2/28/20, 16:42 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 2*

It pays a dividend every year but it's not a tech company
2/28/20, 17:32 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 3*

It was founded in the U.S.A. in *1960* and *went global in the 1980s*
2/28/20, 18:04 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO QUEST 64*


*Answer:* The MNC whose Relative Performance Index is displayed via the green line is *Domino's Pizza, Inc.*


Domino's Pizza, Inc., branded as Domino's, is an American multinational pizza restaurant chain founded in 1960. The corporation is headquartered at the Domino's Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and incorporated in Delaware. On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. By 1990, it had expanded to 1000 international locations.  

In February 2018, the chain became the largest pizza seller worldwide in terms of sales. The fourth quarter of 2019 marked the 104th consecutive quarter of international same store sales growth and the 35th consecutive quarter of U.S. same store sales growth for Domino's Pizza.

 Emphasis on technology innovation helped Domino's achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2019 from digital channels, primarily online ordering and mobile applications. In the U.S., Domino's generates over 65% of sales via digital channels and has developed several innovative ordering platforms,
including those developed for Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo and Twitter ‚Äì as well as Domino's Hotspots¬Æ, an
ordering platform featuring over 200,000 unique, non-traditional delivery locations. In June 2019, through an announced partnership with Nuro,
Domino's furthered its exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery. In late 2019, Domino's opened the Domino's Innovation Garage adjacent
to its headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to fuel continued technology and operational innovation ‚Äì while also launching its GPS technology, allowing
customers to follow the progress of the delivery driver from store to doorstep.

FIAKS community discussions rolled on recent ET reports on ‚Äú_FIS India flouts ATM service conditions of Bank of India_‚Äú.

Many of the bank officials at the top are highly paid and not willing to take any risk at all. They are the best banking brains but appears to have little control over technology. Many a time it appears that they are clueless at all what‚Äôs going on the tech side. They also fail to acknowledge that they need to acquire a certain amount of learning to manage the tech side.To hide this weakness they are appointing big consultants to decide on the tech partners. And the state of the big consultant is no different. They are experts in making presentations and reports and take the help of one the large tech companies and swing the buy decision in their favor and this chain continues. Also, this is one of the reasons for so many hacks are happening.

This malware first discovered in 2019 is like Cerberus, a malware as a Service (MaaS). In other words, a malicious program whose users hire the services with a complete package, available from $200 per month. And this is one of the reasons to fear it right away: anyone can indeed use it for a fee.

The hackers who maintain it provide a protected hosting space for the control server, with an intuitive interface. But also technical support and regular updates. At this price, it is not the cheapest option for beginner pirates, but Cyberark researchers note that it is the simplest and most complete. Especially since this banking malware is more sophisticated than the other examples detected in nature. Raccoon can indeed exploit vulnerabilities in 35 browsers and 60 programs in total.

Bank officials scrutinised the technology supplier Encoded Media three times between 2008, when it first became a technology supplier to the Bank, and 2019, the Guardian can reveal. However, Encoded‚Äôs status as a supplier to the Bank was only revoked following media inquiries in December.

Brave CPO Johnny Ryan believes people should be able to give up their location data to access a map without having that data used in another context later on.

Johnny Ryan has spent the last year and a half trying to convince European regulators that the business model that props up the biggest tech companies in the world ‚Äî behavioral advertising ‚Äî is illegal. Now, he is gearing up for a new fight. This time, he wants regulators to crack down on how tech giants use data inside their own virtual walls.

The charismatic Irishman is the chief policy officer for the web browser company Brave. Back in 2018, he filed a complaint with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner accusing Google and the Interactive Advertising Bureau in Europe of violating European data protection laws through the wanton broadcasting of sensitive personal information in online ad exchanges. Flexing his media savvy, Ryan drummed up tons of press about it, and strategically coordinated with other data rights groups throughout Europe to file similar complaints. It caused a stir.

Gmail has been changing the way we think about email since 2004. In that time, it has gained an eye-popping 1.5 billion users, according to Google. I‚Äôm one of them, and the chances are high that you are as well. A lot has changed in those 15 years. A lot has stayed the same. One of the static components in the world of email is malware, specifically malware in a document attached to your email. Macro viruses, mainly infecting Microsoft Word documents, have been a thing since long before Gmail, of course: hands up who remembers Concept way back in 1995? Microsoft does, no doubt, as it kick-started the Word macro security problem that led to the default disabling of macros in Office 2000. That didn‚Äôt, unfortunately, stop the problem. The attachment malware problem has continued to evolve, and the defenses against this threat vector have evolved as well. Google reckons that malicious documents currently represent 58% of all malware that targets Gmail users. Now Google is fighting back by employing ‚ÄúDeep Learning‚Äù AI to prevent this malware from reaching your inbox.

3/3/20, 13:16 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Technology_: *How to find the right zero trust strategy*

In 2019, Forrester reported that zero trust (ZT) would hit the mainstream in Europe. Security and risk professionals in international organisations with European operations need to understand how to apply zero trust.

Forrester has developed a zero-trust extended framework to guide chief information security officers (CISOs) with their zero-trust strategies.

Zero trust is a conceptual architectural model that uses microperimeters and microsegmentation to secure corporate networks. The approach increases data security through obfuscation techniques, limits the risks associated with excessive user privileges, and dramatically improves security detection and response through analytics and automation.

Google is teaching robots to navigate without human intervention‚Äîa prerequisite to being useful in the real world.

Within 10 minutes of its birth, a baby fawn is able to stand. Within seven hours, it is able to walk. Between those two milestones, it engages in a highly adorable, highly frenetic flailing of limbs to figure it all out.

That‚Äôs the idea behind AI-powered robotics.

*View 6* co-founder 

Zoom is a corporate app for conferencing app. The action is appropriate for Anydesk and TeamViewer.

Zoom is relatively safe. TeamViewer and Anydesk take control of your mobile system from remote and is not safe at all.
Because using these app, especially TeamViewer and Anydesk, one can take full control of mobile. These are usually used by IT folks for debugging, but can be misused by fraudsters.

*View 8* Founder 
Can spread digital viruses.....

*Question* Does these feature ensure that app is safe or does it come with a disclaimer that nothing is 100% safe.
3/3/20, 20:48 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community members views on forcing customers to uninstall unsafe app to make  online banking safe*

*View 12* CXO BANKER 
There are couple of things in this discussion,

1. If techies who are doing sort of RND then they should not be blocked by Mobile banking for doing their RND.

2. In such cases of techies would prefer to have to mobile to keep hygiene between the devices and their usage.

3. Ideally even though we have RDP apps, keep it in disable mode to avoid any risk of sharing. Allow only genuine traffic.

4. Strengthen the controls and permission of the mobile apps rather than giving all permission to read SMS, access contacts, access emails etc.

5. Keep those apps only which are certified and genuine, avoid any custom apps or mostly downloaded apps.
3/3/20, 20:52 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Zoom is a very popular app for conferencing. If an app considers it a problem, then it should let the user create an exception. If it really comes down to this app vs zoom, then for me the choice is clear - Zoom won't be the one getting uninstalled!

CXO BANKER says 

To me this is scary...How does this Payment app figure out if any RDP Apps are there on my phone?

Does this Payment app look for specific apps on the phone or for permissions granted to all apps and then figures out...

Either way, it needs to have privileged information, which should not be available to any other app...

This will give false sense of security to the user... And if a similar malicious app is downloaded, think of the consequences...

While scientists around the world continue to work on treatments and vaccines for the cause of the selling - the coronavirus - the actual cure for the market selloff itself should come as a surprise to nobody. Monday‚Äôs massive 4.6% surge in the S&P 500 was fueled by the belief that the Federal Reserve and other central banks stand ready to prop things up.

That belief proved well-founded: The Federal Reserve cut rates half a point in a surprise emergency move on Tuesday.

While other G-7 finance ministers promised earlier Friday to use ‚Äúall appropriate tools‚Äù to protect the global economy from the coronavirus fallout, after last week investors wanted them to open the doors to the inappropriate tools too.

3/4/20, 13:41 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Security_: *Winston encrypts your home network, preventing Facebook, Google, and Amazon from tracking you*

For long, the way to reclaim one‚Äôs privacy was to just reject technology. Don‚Äôt want Facebook tracking you? Uninstall the app. Don‚Äôt want Apple or Google to know your location? Just use a dumb-phone. It seems unreasonable in today‚Äôs world to reject technology that vehemently. I need Google Maps so that I can use Uber. I need Whatsapp because my family texts me on Whatsapp, and Instagram because it forms a major part of my digital social life. The solution to our privacy problem shouldn‚Äôt be to reject these services, but rather to protect our data.

If your personal data is a needle, think of Winston as a haystack. This minimal-looking, silver-colored ‚Äòblack-box‚Äô connects to your home network and effectively scrambles your outgoing data in a way that‚Äôs impossible to track back to you. Unlike VPNs which just mask your IP address, Winston ‚Äòmuddies the water‚Äô by mixing your data with data from thousands of other Winston users. It connects directly to your home wi-fi, acting as a buffer between the internet and all your devices, from your phones to your smart-speakers, smart TVs, thermostats, and even smart doorbells‚Ä¶ effectively allowing you to use all your internet-based services, but preventing large corporations, ad-networks, hackers, and even your internet providers from gathering any accurate data from you.

*Shop Safe Act Could Hold Amazon Liable for Selling Fake Products*

Co-sponsored by four members of the House, the Shop Safe Act of 2020 was created to help protect consumers by making online shopping hubs accountable for selling counterfeit goods. The problem right now is that unless you know the ins and outs of how sites like Amazon really work, it‚Äôs unclear who you‚Äôre really dealing with and what you might actually be buying.

That‚Äôs because mixed in with all the products sold by Amazon, Walmart or others are product listings posted by third-party sellers that look almost identical to those posted by Amazon or Walmart themselves. Often, the best way to tell who is really responsible for shipping and selling a product is to look at the ‚Äúby‚Äù or ‚Äúfulfilled by‚Äù tag to see if an item is coming directly from an online retailer, or somewhere else.

3/4/20, 17:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Management_: *Leadership Is the Opposite of Management*

Peter Drucker not long before he died said something during an NPR interview that stuck with me. I don't remember the exact quote, but it was something like: "there is too much emphasis today put on leadership; what is needed today is more emphasis on management."

The remark struck me as odd because like most people, I thought the two concepts were basically interchangeable. Over the past 15 years, though, I've come to understand that while there are a few individuals who are good at both leading people and managing people, the two skills are wildly different and even, in a certain sense, opposites.

3/4/20, 19:17 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _startups_: *For our overhyped, overvalued tech startups, soon the reckoning will come*

Globally, more than half of outstanding government debt offers a negative yield ‚Äì which is to say that many investors now have to pay for the privilege of lending money to states, where they at least know their assets will most likely be safe. But even corporations, which have more of a chance of defaulting, have been able to issue bonds with yields below zero, because the interest that their debt offers is marginally higher ‚Äì or less negative, if you will ‚Äì than the interest on other assets.

So how did the rules of the economy get turned on their head like this? Interest rates were initially cut in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis, in order to kickstart economic recovery. But in the absence of any real growth to speak of, they‚Äôve been stuck there ever since. The result is both cheap borrowing and lots of lending.

Most travelers generally look for a policy with cancellation benefits and emergency medical benefits that cover them while they‚Äôre traveling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt this point, the only cancellation coverage available is the ‚Äòcancel for any reason‚Äô insurance, which is a time-sensitive upgrade.‚Äù The ‚Äúcancel for any reason‚Äù coverage usually has to be purchased within 21 days from the first payment for a trip, whether that be airfare or a hotel reservation, and can cost about 40 percent more than a standard trip cancellation insurance. However, the tradeoff might be worth it since ‚Äúcancel for any reason‚Äù reimburses travelers up to 75 percent of their trip cost.

3/5/20, 13:15 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _image recognition_ *A new AI chip can perform image recognition tasks in nanoseconds*

A new type of artificial eye, made by combining light-sensing electronics with a neural network on a single tiny chip, can make sense of what it‚Äôs seeing in just a few nanoseconds, far faster than existing image sensors.

*Why it matters*: Computer vision is integral to many applications of AI‚Äîfrom driverless cars to industrial robots to smart sensors that act as our eyes in remote locations‚Äîand machines have become very good at responding to what they see. But most image recognition needs a lot of computing power to work. Part of the problem is a bottleneck at the heart of traditional sensors, which capture a huge amount of visual data, regardless of whether or not it is useful for classifying an image. Crunching all that data slows things down

A sensor that captures and processes an image at the same time, without converting or passing around data, makes image recognition much faster using much less power.

3/5/20, 17:31 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Leadership_ *Jack Welch‚Äôs Approach to Leadership*
Jack Welch was heralded by many as the greatest leader of his era. As CEO of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, he transformed it from a company known for appliances and lightbulbs to a multinational corporation that stretched into financial services and media as well as industrial products. He was initially criticized for cost-cutting and layoffs, which earned him the moniker ‚ÄúNeutron Jack,‚Äù but as GE‚Äôs revenues expanded and its share price soared in the ensuing years, he was lauded. In recent years, many have questioned his strategy, leadership style, and legacy. Was he too hard-nosed? Did his relentless push for growth, particularly at GE Capital, sow the seeds for the broader company‚Äôs later struggles? Was he really a CEO that others should emulate?

Of course, Jack did made mistakes throughout his career. And perhaps he isn‚Äôt the ideal model for 21st century leadership. However, as someone who knew him both professionally and personally, I learned from him, and I believe that others still can too. Here are three of his principles that I believe can work for today‚Äôs managers as well as they did for him.

‚ñ™Get your people decisions right. 

‚ñ™Speak with candor.

‚ñ™Be insatiably curious

3/5/20, 19:25 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Board_ *Why the CEO Shouldn‚Äôt Also Be the Board Chair*

Beneath all the reporting on fatally flawed airplane design, serial ten-figure operating losses from big name startups, and Russian-linked presidential election information hackings, there lies an organizational leadership truth from the debacles at Boeing, WeWork, and Facebook: Be wary of giving the CEO job and the board chair job to one person.

As the complexity around and scrutiny of corporate leaders have intensified in recent years, proposals to abandon the Two Job ‚Äì One Person model have become the most common type of governance proposal submitted by shareholders. This is unsurprising. A board chair leads the board‚Äôs effort to excel at advising on strategy, monitoring performance, overseeing finance and controls, and evaluating management. A CEO establishes within the company a shared set of values, practices, and goals that enables the company to execute its strategic plan and build a meaningful future. To grow, a company needs both of these roles performed thoroughly and well.

If depositors are allowed to buy deposit insurance from outside companies to protect themselves, which only means that depositors will shift the risk from one financial entity (bank) to another financial entity (insurer). Most likely if a big bank fails it will take down the insurer also.

If a loan is covered by insurance in case of a person‚Äôs demise, why not his deposit be covered by insurance in case of demise of the institution!

Theoretical conversation IMHO. When shareholders and investors make superlative profits ... from Infosys to SBI cards, then very few questions arise about morals and ethics.

The whole concept of creating a company is to delink it from the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the company. Mostly they are ‚ÄúLimited Liability‚Äù Companies with varying degrees of accountability towards shareholders and customers, and is generally stated in MoA/ AoA.

That said, failure of an institution, especially of a bank, does raise many questions and reduces trust, an absolutely critical prerequisite for banking system as a whole.

Investor appetite for risk generally appears to have returned to a level in the middle of its historical range but remains elevated for some important classes of assets.

The majority of the banks claim that their preferred banking services product is supposed to provide clients with a complete digital and paper-free experience. Isn‚Äôt this offered to all the customers as banks are pushing customers to go digital? How is normal banking services getting differentiated from the preferred banking services? 

Isn‚Äôt it the time for the bureaucratic set-up within the banks to think beyond the Preferred Banking as only offering big fancy Sofas to the clients?

3/9/20, 14:38 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community thought leaders  on PhonePe Rapid Migration and on unique Architecture of UPI says*

PhonePe  is up with all the services @YBL which is Yes Bank‚Äôs IP, got transferred to ICICI Bank  at the tech backend, not affecting PhonePe‚Äôs customers, and allowing the platform to continue business as usual. Further, it also saved PhonePe users from re-registering their accounts and applying for a new UPI handle. HOW? 

One must however acknowledge that the ONLY reason this is possible is the unique 4-party architecture of UPI - this would've been a 90 day journey in the 3 party model - so kudos to several top leaders for having conceived such a policy resilient architecture!

3/9/20, 16:24 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member shared this PR in the media appreciating great role played by NPCI, RBI to get Phone Pe/ Bharat Pe service up*

Media report say 

ICICI Bank assembled a multifunctional 40-member team to immediately step in and ensure customer disruptions could be minimised. People from different departments like legal, account opening, technology, business banking and others were part of the team in order to ensure decision making and execution was prompt. 

ICICI Bank had to establish multiple features and services such as creating nodal accounts, reconciliation systems, processing capacities in the back end to be able to support transactions through PhonePe. Its officials worked very closely with the PhonePe team on getting the services up and running quickly.

PhonePe had been in discussions with ICICI Bank for months *after NPCI mandated a multiparty model for all UPI third party applications*. Even BharatPe was processing some part of its daily volume through ICICI Bank. But, Yes Bank was still their major processor.

ICICI Bank officials also pointed out to the *important role played by NPCI in the migration of services*. As a settlement platform, NPCI now has to route transactions originating from Yes Bank handles into ICICI Bank systems

As of now with permission from NPCI and RBI, all @YBL transactions are being driven to ICICI Bank. They will soon release an additional handle with ICICI Bank as well.Once Yes Bank moratorium is over, it will mean PhonePe users will have a choice of two handles from two different banks to work with. 

Also PhonePe shifted its nodal accounts to ICICI Bank to ensure that its merchants receive the funds on time and the confidence in the system is not hurt. 

The agility shown by PhonePe and ICICI Bank with *the right support provided by the NPCI can be a great case study.*

3/9/20, 17:07 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _IOT_: *Your smart home device could be a threat to our elections*

Data from IoT devices‚Äîsomeone entering a building, driving, using a sink or coffee machine‚Äîcould make all of us more susceptible to highly targeted spear-phishing attacks.

PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM VOTING : Beyond blocking access to political information, a foreign agent or group might seek to stop people from voting by creating targeted chaos, whether by disrupting power systems, generating false weather or traffic reports, or otherwise triggering local emergencies that divert attention on Election Day.

Smart cities and the industrial internet of things are already targets, as evidenced by the yearslong history of Russia-attributed disruptions to Ukrainian power systems. Hacking home alarm or water systems could create politically microtargeted local emergencies that distract people who would otherwise vote.

3/9/20, 19:01 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _CEOs_: *What CEOs Need to Know About Innovation (With Jason Schlachter)*

Jason highlighted the fact that there is no silver bullet to innovation. essential, there are studies that show that 65 to 85% of all AI projects fail. *The truth is when innovation works, it‚Äôs working because of the business driving it in the first place, but the business must want change in the first place*. There needs to be a customer problem they‚Äôre trying to fix and they need to be willing to invest the time and money into the success of the innovation project.

When looking at disruptive innovation, you can create a small team with different functions and get them to drive the effort, similar to a startup. This way they‚Äôre free from the organizational constraints and bureaucracy, allowing them to build the momentum they need to succeed. In short, unbranded companies have more flexibility and creative freedom.

3/9/20, 23:50 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community thought leaders on YES bank handling by RBI & Government* he says 

The way Govt &RBi are handling Yes Bank crisis is going to create  a long term mess. 

1. The proposal to treat Tier 1 bond as junior to common equity will virtually destroy the marker for Tier 1 bonds.  The yield on bonds of this type will double from present levels.  So not only investors in Yes Bank  , even those invested in other bank bonds will bleed profusely .  It also will create a huge trust deficit in investors minds as the Govt and RBI have virtually  short changed the Bond holders by inverting the loss absorption order .  

2.  Govt blanket undertaking to protect all depositor money is a bad precedent and it also shows gross unfairness to the existing depositors of PMC Bank who are struggling for several months without any assurance or resolution in sight .  Govt reliefs should be restricted to retail depositors upto a threshold and not corporate deposits.

Another thing puzzles me is why RBI has not applied PCA first, when they were and are fully aware of the deteriorating situation of the bank for the last 9-12 months. 
It seems like more of a show me the bank and we will show you the policy kind of message is coming out based on the decisions taken by RBI in last 6-7 months.
In all this 'trust' is taking a bit hit.

3/11/20, 09:23 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Community members is asking a QUESTION* _why bank CEO need to to given such monies *$ 12,000,000* as stated in the news above ?_

He says State Bank of India (SBI), in its annual report 2017-18 released on Monday, mentioned that *Rajnish Kumar*, the Chairman and Managing Director of the bank drew a gross salary of *Rs 14,25,594 (USD 20,000)*  by March 31, 2018. I repeat his *YEARLY* salary is just *USD 20,000* 

‚ñ™What salary are we paying to the amazingly talented *CEOs of many Cooperative Bank* which far better managed than YES Bank?

‚ñ™What salary is paid to the Prime Minister or President of country? 

*Isn‚Äôt something going wrong here ????*  Invite views that will published as part *FIAKS bespoke* report
3/11/20, 09:44 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts shared this update on CEO SALARY DEBATE*
*View 4*


He says 

Management guru Peter Drucker believed the proper ratio between a chief executive‚Äôs pay and that of the average worker should be around *20-to-1* as it was in 1965. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI), in a report last summer by Lawrence Mishel and Jessica Schieder, shows that CEO pay is and continues to be dramatically higher now. CEO pay in the US peaked in 2000 at $20.7 million (in 2016 dollars), 376 times the pay of the typical worker. In 1995, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 
‚ñ™123-to-1; in 1989, 
‚ñ™it was 59-to-1; in 1978, 
‚ñ™it was 30-to-1; and in 1965, ‚ñ™it was, as Drucker‚Äôs ratio would have it, 20-to-1.
3/11/20, 09:44 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: First of all CEO of SBI is a Employee where as many Private Banks and Co-operative Banks CEO or Chairman‚Äôs are either Promoter, Owner, or Share Holders. So it is presumed by Private Bankers CEO to draw the salary and perks package such that they are taking away the profits by all means of planning and without hesitation the auditors and officials approve without seeing the efforts and time hours input by them which includes wife, daughters, Sons, Friends and other family members.
This is the said state of the current scenarios in all publically held private run banks and companies in India.

3/11/20, 10:01 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Many members of this community have,  innumerable times, said that the CEO and other cxos should be held personally responsible for things like data breaches,  big loans going bad,  etc.

3/11/20, 10:21 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: If a private bank's CEO, after drawing such enormous salary, becomes so corrupt and ends up taking kickbacks to the tune of Rs. 600 crores from one entity /customer. How is that a govt bank's CEO at not even half the salary is not so corrupt? Or is it just a matter of time that this bubble also bursts? Do govt banks have stronger checks and balances in place?
3/11/20, 10:27 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: In Govt banks, there is rotation of postings. Also preliminary checks and balances are in place. If politicians not interfered then PNB & NiMo wouldn‚Äôt have happened.
Also, there are some dept in government who also keeps tab on high ranking officers for corrupt practise and they are answerable to whistle blowers where as private companies and banks are above all these.
3/11/20, 10:34 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: After ICICI and YES bank episodes, these govt departments should also watch private bankers for corruption.

It is more common in case of a promoter run entity, because they exercise control and take calls. Often unilaterally. And with information asymmerty. Whereas in public sector entities the governance is much more strictly defined and followed (at least on paper) and therefore a one man call is more difficult
3/11/20, 11:22 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Oil Crisis_ *Oil Crisis Leaves Norway Facing Its First Recession Since 2008*

Norway now risks sinking into its first recession since the financial crisis of 2008 after a collapse in oil prices changed everything for western Europe‚Äôs biggest petroleum producer.

Handelsbanken is telling its clients that Norway‚Äôs mainland economy will probably start shrinking next quarter. The richest Nordic nation depends on oil and gas for more than a third of its exports, and economists have responded to the latest sell-off by warning that Norges Bank will need to cut interest rates next week, potentially by as much as half a point from 1.5%.

3/11/20, 11:42 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS community CXO of Leading bank in gulf shared this update_  on *Understanding Oil*

‚ñ™Ô∏èUS shale producers have added a huge surplus into the global oil market , making the US a net oil exporter . OPEC+ Russia were trying to keep supplies constrained to keep prices up. They tried to bankrupt the US producers in 2014 but failed .

‚ñ™Ô∏èLast week there was no agreement on further cuts . This seems to be a decision made to push the over leveraged US shale producers to bankruptcy by unleashing a supply glut in a falling demand environment . The consequences are complex .

‚ñ™Ô∏èA large portion of the US junk bonds market is funding US shale producers . At USD 55 levels they were profitable . At USD 35 levels it will be difficult . The Saudi and Russian aim is to cripple this supply and then raise rates once bankruptcies have removed some of this .

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis was tried in 2014 and did not work . In 2020 given the demand pressures , the amount of debt and the size of the US shale production , this oil price war will hurt if prices stay below USD 50 to 60 range

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Russians have built financial reserves over the last 6 years and can withstand the huge fiscal deficit that low oil prices and continued economic sanctions will lead to . They claim they can hold out for multiple years.  Not so sure .

‚ñ™Ô∏èSaudis will face larger fiscal deficits in selling oil so cheap . The show case Aramco listing is already trading below the IPO price . The Saudi govt will need to borrow and spend more and keep the growth initiatives going domestically . Funding becomes a question mark

‚ñ™Ô∏èOther OPEC producers will see a knock on impact of lower prices . Real estate in the Middle East will be the first victim . Recipients of aid from the Middle East as well as the value chains supplying goods to them will suffer 

‚ñ™Ô∏èNon oil producing countries will see their oil import bills lowered dramatically if oil sustains at the USD 35 levels for a few months . Consumers will benefit and central banks will have monetary space to cut rates as deflation gets imported in

‚ñ™Ô∏èBut the destruction in aggregate global demand is what is spooking the markets . Given integrated value chains, demand destruction will outweigh the positive impact of lower oil prices globally

‚ñ™Ô∏èAdd on Coronavirus uncertainty , a US election year , already weak European ,Japanese , Chinese economies and we have a major global risk off . On its 11 th anniversary the Global Bull market is teetering on the brink of ceding ground to the bears

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe usual monetary stimulus is still on the table but seems to have diminishing marginal utility . Fiscal steps will be needed to reinflate and reflate the global economy . Those resources are limited

‚ñ™Ô∏èAdd in the geopolitical issues and we have convergent , global, large scale risks . The need is for a fresh concerted , convergent and united action by the G7 and G20 leadership

‚ñ™Ô∏èStatesmanship is rare at present in the anti globalisation, ‚Äúmy country first‚Äùenvironment . The market forces will take time to sort this out and the cost will be painful . ‚ÄúRIP Good Times‚Äùas a PE fund wrote in 2008 before the GFC tsunami . We have to move fast,unitedly
3/11/20, 13:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Cyber Security_: *Stop saying employees are the weakest link in cybersecurity*

What‚Äôs wrong with believing employees are the weak point?‚Äù, you might ask. Given the ever-increasing frequency data breaches ‚Äì with human error often being either a cause or catalyst in the majority of cases ‚Äì you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that employees are naturally at fault.

But they‚Äôre not ‚Äì and there are a few logical reasons why.

The weakest link?
Firstly, framing the conversation like this doesn‚Äôt get us anywhere. Are football players to blame when they lose a match? Well, in a way, but the players are also to ‚Äòblame‚Äô when they win. And even when they do lose, telling them that they‚Äôre the problem is only going to demoralize and lead to further losses.

Secondly, if blame has to lie somewhere, it surely lies with the security awareness programs rather than the employees who rely on those programs to better protect themselves. The reason that human-error breaches continue to occur at such at rate is that ‚Äì and let‚Äôs be honest here ‚Äì security awareness training in its current form just doesn‚Äôt work.

3/11/20, 14:59 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Corporate cards_: *New tech startups challenge AmEx in the niche corporate card market*

For decades, corporate credit cards were a boring industry, dominated by money-colored AmExes, the default choice for power lunches and client dinners around the world.

Now, a fleet of richly funded startups wants to change that. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured big money into a growing group of companies that make credit cards for businesses. That includes more than $1 billion in funding and debt for just three startups: card-makers Ramp, Divvy and three-year-old Brex Inc., which was valued last summer at an eye-watering $2.6 billion, according to PitchBook data.

The fresh interest in the industry comes as American Express Co.‚Äîthe undisputed leader in the market‚Äîrevamps its corporate card portfolio, raising the fees on its cards this week after adding benefits for Uber rides and Hilton stays. Accenture estimates that overall spending on business credit cards in the U.S. will climb to $1.1 trillion in 2024 from $625 billion in 2019.

3/11/20, 18:08 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Business_: *How to Work With Someone Who‚Äôs Disengaged*

If you love your job, consider yourself lucky. According to global estimates, just 13% of people are engaged at work, which contributes to a huge productivity loss. In the United States alone, disengagement costs the economy around $500 billion every year (that is roughly the size of the global beer industry). These estimates are based on a simple calculation, namely scaling the average differences in productivity between engaged and disengaged workers.

Engagement can be interpreted as a broad indicator of how motivated an employee is at work. This means low engagement levels can be expected to play a significant role in driving the massive loss in productivity we are seeing worldwide. Employee performance is as much the result of a person‚Äôs motivation as it of their talent or ability. But while companies are relatively good at hiring for talent, especially when talent can be equated to hard skills or past experience, they are generally less apt at hiring for soft skills, including motivational traits.  A candidate could seem to have high potential on paper or during an interview but fail to live up to it on the job.

3/11/20, 19:55 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: This is one post whose findings I have to question.  I went to the article to understand their definition of "successful" and that led me to the source which they use. This is a list of 100 most visible brands on social media.  (1). This is a list of brands and not companies with NatGeo on top and products like Playstation,  Dove, Smirnoff and Air Jordan in it. 

Extrapolating from there to zodiac signs of CEOs is stretching things too far. Smirnoff is listed but not Diageo - wouldn't it mean the product owner is more important in this table than the CEO? Besides they have less than half covered in the zodiac table starting from a list of 100 . 

So if you are sceptical of the zodiac,  then this should debunk ther article. And if you are an ardent devotee,  then the findings are tautological - flamboyant people are more visible on social media and hence nothing for you in the article. 

Besides the zodiac has moved on (see precession!).

3. If the provider owns the @provider side, doesn't the customer own the name@ side of the handle? Like I own my email id.

The presence of the name gives false assurance to the sender that there is some value to the name when none exists. Not asking for it will ensure that the sender gives the due importance to the number. 95% success with any form of fuzzy name matching is too poor and can‚Äôt see it becoming better in the near future, mostly due to how users act. To this, he further added- when you get a new email id or number,  you use that before you associate a name with that. A name is what you call it in your address book and not what the other person calls themselves. So a name is a ‚Äònickname‚Äô that you give on your side and not necessarily the name of the account holder.

It was recently reported that Google was planning to move the personal data of its UK users out of the EU and into the US. Several outlets reporting on this story have suggested that this would mean that, as Britain has left the EU, the data would no longer be covered by the EU‚Äôs world-leading data protection law, the GDPR.

If this were the case, it would make it much harder to access personal data Google holds on you or to work out how, why and for what purposes the data was being used. It would also make it more difficult to make Google correct or delete that data and Google would be able to process your data free from the conditions currently imposed by the GDPR. But this representation of the situation is misleading.

Your end-of-workday shame for not having accomplished what you set out to is often the result of unrealistic expectations, says Heidi Grant, the director of research and development for Americas Learning at EY and the author of No One Understands You and What to Do About It, among others. ‚ÄúMost humans are overly optimistic‚Äîwe enter the day with an expectation and plan of getting all sorts of things done,‚Äù she says. But the trouble is, ‚Äúwe are not grounding our expectations in the reality of the work that we do.‚Äù So invariably when 6 o‚Äôclock rolls around, we feel anxious and guilt-ridden says Whitney Johnson, the executive coach and author most recently of Disrupt Yourself. ‚ÄúYou look at what you didn‚Äôt get done, and you get that sinking feeling deep in your soul that you are not enough.‚Äù But, she says, ‚Äúyou mustn‚Äôt feel like a failure.‚Äù Conquering workplace guilt involves a combination of getting savvier about how you chip away at your to-do list, improving how you manage your own (and others‚Äô) expectations about what you can realistically achieve over the course of a day, and building self-compassion for those times when you fail to live up to them. Here‚Äôs how.

Reframe the situation: 
When the nagging voice in your head tells you that you‚Äôre failing your coworkers and that your boss is frustrated by your inability to finish certain tasks, Grant says you need to recognize those negative ruminations for what they are, ‚Äúa story you‚Äôre telling yourself.‚Äù

3/13/20, 09:37 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member is asking REGULATORS*

So much of panic & chaos with YES bank moratorium. What happens if *Google or Whatsapp and other customers facing Fintechs which are not Banks* decides to shut its business operations in India. 

*Q1* Will government again ask SBI to rescue all the retail customers? 

*Q2* Can you imagine the kind of risk we are exposed to? 

*Q3* Is India missing on convent educated thought leaders who can walk Nation First?
3/13/20, 09:42 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 09:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: This is an Apple to Oranges comparison. No doubt that google and fb are serving as lifelines of people but there is no public money at stake.
Yes moratorium and SBi helping to restructure is to find viables ways to protect people‚Äôs funds. Its to ensure that loans are restructured and recovered and deposits are safely invested. 

This reminds of the financial recession when i worked in wall street in 2008. US govt didn‚Äôt bail out a few banks but did provide help to GS and some other financial institutions with the same intent
3/13/20, 09:57 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: +1
3/13/20, 09:57 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: The fintechs are effectively decoupled from the 'banking' side. The only plumbing is a set of APIs. They do own the customer experience though, but nothing that can't be shifted to another entity. As I had asked a q befire, it might be good for npci to finally enable @privider upi handles for the fintechs so that this separation is clean and apparent.
3/13/20, 10:13 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member says*

Hiring experts is good business. You can‚Äôt be an expert in everything, so tapping in others who have spent years going deep on topics will help you get where you want to go faster. Of course, I‚Äôm a big proponent of this, I myself sell my expertise, and teach others how to sell their expertise because I want to help business owners succeed!

But when you‚Äôre just starting out, if you don‚Äôt do the leg work of building the foundation of your business first, or at least have a very big hand in it, you‚Äôre leaving out the key ingredient that is going to make your business special, unique and successful: YOU.

The world is now looking at alternatives on everything.

*Views 4* CMO
Top leaders are turning marketing teams into event managers and brochure printers. Marketing team are  asked for ROI on everything. It‚Äôs very easy for marketing team to justify such full page AD to their leaders hence they blow a lot money into brochure printing or full page ads. Decision makers in majority of the organisations don‚Äôt allow team to do any non-standard initiatives as it is seen as expense and not an investment. Also lot of time is wasted of marketing team to justify it to the management team.  Many good marketeers are leaving these organisations.  Brochure printing champions are able to survive in such suffocating large organisations.
Communities like FIAKS can be right platform to invest if banks wants convey Integrity, Transparency, Trust or Service to the Nation. As any false claim will be exposed here immediately

Bill Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman, said the bank had enough cash available at its branches to meet its clients‚Äô needs. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt keep large amounts of cash in big bills in the branches because it‚Äôs dangerous for our employees and there is low demand,‚Äù he said.

Most people use far less cash than they did even a decade ago, as credit cards and other forms of digital payment have become the norm. Still, stacks of bills are psychologically reassuring, and are often what people, even the wealthiest, turn to in an unpredictable world.

One of the biggest cash haulers, Brink‚Äôs, had ‚Äúa big spike in demand‚Äù this week from some of its bank clients, according to Edward Cunningham, a company spokesman. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre putting more cash into branches, they‚Äôre requesting more frequent replenishment of A.T.M.s.‚Äù

3/16/20, 13:37 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Security_ *Your Windows 10 PC and Apple MacBook have a serious flaw that cannot be fixed*

Intel acknowledged that it was aware of the issues last year. Since then, it has released a patch designed to address the problem. However, Positive Technologies researchers claim the software update only partially solves the issue. A spokesman for the US chipset manufacturer explained that they cannot secure hardcoded ROM in existing computers ‚Äì so the only way to keep users safe if to create patches that quarantine potential targets for attack within the system.

The latest crisis comes at a time of increasingly fierce competition with AMD, developer of the popular Ryzen chip. Apple is believed to be developing its own chipsets to power future MacBook models. By designing its own chip architecture ‚Äì as it already does with its iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch ‚Äì the company is able to tailor the requirements to exactly what is needed to power its own operating system.

3/16/20, 17:17 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _precious metals_ : *Price Of Physical Gold Decouples From Paper Gold*

The enormous increase in demand is straining our supply chains. BullionStar has supplier relations with most of the major refineries, mints and wholesalers around the world. Most of our suppliers don‚Äôt have any stock of precious metals and are not taking orders currently. The U.S. Mint for example announced just this Thursday that American Silver Eagle coins are sold out. The large wholesalers in the U.S. are completely sold out of ALL gold and ALL silver and are not able to replenish.

We are already sold out of several products and will sell out of additional products shortly if this supply squeeze continues. All products listed as ‚ÄúIn Stock‚Äù on our website are available for immediate delivery. For items listed as ‚ÄúPre-Sale‚Äù, the items have been ordered and paid by us with incoming shipments on the way to us.

UPI is being heavily promoted for its simplicity enabling masses to use this payment option. However, the fraudsters are causing hindrance and creating distrust in the minds of common people. Have a look at the graph which shows the rise in UPI transactions which again from fraudsters‚Äô perspective gives them a glowing opportunity to create more frauds.

3/17/20, 13:22 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Brand_ *What Does the Symmetry of Your Logo Say About Your Brand?*

Though what is considered ‚Äúeffective‚Äù may vary across products, there are a few golden rules that have been long-established in design. Symmetry is perhaps one of the most common. People tend to perceive symmetrical shapes as more attractive and preferable, in comparison to asymmetrical ones. As such, it is not surprising that brand managers favor using symmetrical logos. In an analysis we conducted on 423 major brands, 95% had logos that were perceived as symmetrical.

‚ÄúExciting brands‚Äù are those that market themselves as ‚Äúcool,‚Äù ‚Äútrendy,‚Äù ‚Äúyouthful,‚Äù ‚Äúspirited,‚Äù ‚Äúimaginative,‚Äù or ‚Äúdaring.‚Äù (Think brands like Mountain Dew, Red Bull, Nike, and Tesla).

3/17/20, 17:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Millennials Don‚Äôt Change Jobs As Often As You Think*

In general, workers are job-hopping less often today than they were 30-plus years ago. A recent NBER working paper by Raven Molloy, Christopher Smith, and Abigail K. Wozniak shows that the share of workers with less than one year of tenure fell from 18-20% in the 1980s and 1990s to about 16% in recent years. At the same time, the share of workers with more than 20 years of tenure has increased from 8-9% in the 1980s and 1990s to about 10% in recent years.

The second key reason for why employees are perceived as switching jobs more frequently is the generational narrative, branding millennials as the job hopping generation. A number of recent studies and surveys refute this view, but perception can take a long time to change.

Enter Fujitsu with a new compression algorithm that, it says, can reduce the size of a video by 90%. The not-so-insignificant caveat is that the resulting video can only be interpreted by artificial intelligence (AI) because of the level of degradation.

The key aspect of the new technology - developed by scientists at the Japanese firm - is that it automatically analyzes areas within an image that AI prioritizes and compresses data to the minimum size that AI can recognize

European Union data-protection regulators have clashed in recent weeks over accusations that some countries are too slow and lenient in enforcing the bloc‚Äôs privacy law, ostensibly allowing large technology firms to get away with violations.

Some authorities want to force their counterparts in other countries to speed up major privacy investigations. They point to the Irish regulator‚Äôs multiple open cases involving Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google and other multinationals. Four of the open cases are related to a Facebook security breach in September 2018.

3/18/20, 15:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *How Secure Are Your Confidential Documents In Photocopying And Printing Services?*

If walls have ears to your conversations, your photocopier and scanner sure has eyes to your documents. Most companies use these machines to produce and send copies of important documents to other clients and colleagues. Some of the information in these documents should be restricted to only a few concerned people. If you use machines that do not secure your data and privacy, you are at risk of leaking the contents and information into the wrong hands. Copier security is important since some of these are also integrated with computers which use hard drives and connectivity. Do not risk your confidential documents falling into the hands of hackers by ensuring you are equipped and secured.

3/19/20, 11:19 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Authorised push payments Frauds_ : *Bank transfer fraud losses soar to almost ¬£500m in 2019. Fraud refunds rise - but just two in five victims get their money back*

Losses from bank transfer fraud soared to ¬£456m last year, despite dozens of banks signing up to a code to protect their customers from these type of scams.

*What is bank transfer fraud?*

Bank transfer fraud sees you tricked into sending money to the bank account of a fraudster. They often pose as your bank, your solicitor or official bodies such as HMRC, using sophisticated methods of impersonation ‚Äì ‚Äòspoofing‚Äô the genuine contact details of these organisations.

Sometimes, fraudsters pose as banks and contact you to tell your account has been ‚Äòcompromised‚Äô, and to transfer your savings to an account set up by the fraudster, which they have told you is safe.

3/19/20, 13:58 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _WHF_ *Cybersecurity When It Comes To Remote Work Means Zero Trust*

As remote work becomes the norm for employees and companies, an important discussion that‚Äôs taking place in IT organizations is the discussion around cybersecurity.

You can use this opportunity to increase cybersecurity awareness across your organization.

One of the core principles in cybersecurity that‚Äôs taking shape these days is around zero trust. That‚Äôs how companies can provide a much higher level of security and if done right, can provide a much better user experience.

The ‚Äã*Zero Trust* ‚Äãtenet means that from the start, every action is not trusted. In a Zero Trust model, in addition to authentication. there‚Äôs constant monitoring to ensure abnormal or risky behavior is identified immediately and remediation steps can be taken. Monitoring includes how users interact with an application, from what network, from what device, during what time of day and other variables. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, a behavioral profile can be built for each user. It‚Äôs important to monitor that so that you can identify unusual circumstances and the only way to effectively do that is with artificial intelligence so that remediation can happen at the speed of computers.

3/20/20, 11:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *The dollar is in high demand, prone to dangerous appreciation*

The world now faces the opposite problem: a dollar in high demand, prone to dangerous appreciation. It has, unsurprisingly, strengthened against the currencies of emerging markets, which have suffered brutal capital outflows since late January (see chart). But the dollar has, more surprisingly, also strengthened against safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc, and pushed currencies like the pound and the Norwegian krone to their weakest level in decades. On March 18th Bloomberg‚Äôs dollar spot index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, hit an all-time high, its seventh consecutive rise. Anyone seeking to swap their yen, francs or euros for dollars (and then swap them back again after a few months) must pay a premium, known as the cross-currency basis, which is deducted from any interest they earn. That premium has risen sharply on several occasions in the past two weeks.

3/21/20, 18:51 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS Vdo_ 83 *Dr. Thomas Cowan, M.D. discusses the Coronavirus*

He suggests that  5G internet causes COVID-19 has some people convinced their smartphones could kill them. Meanwhile, critics of the video‚Äîwhich was filmed at a March 12 health summit in Tucson, Arizona, and uploaded to YouTube by the account Parents for Healthcare Rights‚Äîare slamming it and saying that it's spreading bogus information in the midst of a very real and serious global crisis.

The video shows a presentation by *Dr. Thomas Cowan, M.D,* who claims that, because Africa was not as affected by the coronavirus outbreak at first, there was reason to believe 5G could be the cause of the virus. His argument was, "Africa is not a 5G region." That line of thinking seems to be debunked as of Thursday, since the World Health Organization has confirmed around 640 cases of coronavirus in Africa, according to the BBC.

5G is a new internet technology launched by mobile companies in 2020. It operates on the same concept as a 4G smartphone but is expected to be faster and more reliable when it comes to internet speeds.

3/23/20, 10:16 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: JFYI: To best of my knowledge, Validity of VISA is required to enter the country. Your stat duration is decided by immigration officer. 
Since I have entered many times a country when my visa was valid for 2 days and business meeting was scheduled for one week.

3/24/20, 11:25 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS BESPOKE_ *Why Should An EMV Card Have Magnetic Stripe At All?*

Well, the issue is not EMV implementation on the acquiring side. It is a non-EMV implementation on the issuing side.Card cloning is very easy for any Magnetic Swipe card and very difficult for EMV Chip card. Current ATM card cloning are all examples of MagStripe card cloning as banks have not fully phased out MagStripe card to EMV Chip card.

3/24/20, 12:05 - +1 (916) 837-0472: Retaining the mag Stripe was purely for fallback (or backward compatibility) purpose at a time when many PoS and ATM readers were not yet chip ready/certified. With acceptance infrastructure updated with chip read capabilities today, there is no need to have a real mag Stripe on the card anymore. The same mag Stripe data is in any case encoded on the chip as well. Hope this helps.

3/24/20, 13:24 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Chinese Virus Crisis_ *The Coronavirus Crisis doesn't have to lead to layoffs*

Leaders are obligated to make responsible decisions to keep their companies afloat. But those who manage the economic effects of this crisis in a clear and compassionate way create more value for their companies and will come out of this pandemic stronger than ever before.

Consider decelerating pay decreases for lower salary ranges to protect employees who are the most vulnerable. For example, you might reduce salaries of your highest paid employees by 10%, mid-range salaried employees by 5%, and everyone else above a certain threshold by half of that. This is what was done at BIDMC during its cost-reduction‚Äîand employees appreciated that senior leaders tried all sorts of creative approaches to minimize head-count reduction.

3/24/20, 16:19 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Managing people_ *Rethink your relationship with your vendors*

The problem with current company-vendor relations starts at the beginning of the relationship. Companies go through long, expensive vetting processes for vendors, often spending months and significant resources to ensure they select the best bidder. Then, instead of welcoming them with open arms, they negotiate hard on pricing, delay payments, and generally squeeze them in any possible way to get the best possible terms. Despite all the effort that went into the selection process, companies often view vendors as ‚Äúeasily replaceable‚Äù and keep an arm's length relationship.

Neither organizations nor service providers benefit when the wrong approach is employed. Organizations should take the lead in treating their vendors and gig workers like strategic partners and employees.

FIAKS Community is asking that in this entire China Virus Pandemic

*Q1* Are we buying essential goods from near by grocery shops *OR* are we buying from the e-commerce portals who have been offering great discounts to us ? *Do you realise how important are these near by grocery shops* 
Isn‚Äôt it a time for all of us to make a purchase decision with *PURPOSE* ? 

*Q2* Are we realising *how important is the CASH* in this digital age. Are our Grandmothers & Grandfathers able to use digital payment products to buy essential goods? 



_Invite community members to opine and share their thoughts. We will cover all your views in the FIAKS Bespoke report_
3/24/20, 18:00 - +91 90233 89243: 1. As far as my personal consumption is concerned, I still buy my groceries from local kirana shop and haven't used any online groceries, since I need to see, touch and feel the product before I take it home, ofcourse this is my personal opinion. 2.  Grandmother n Grandfathers needs a truly one click experience (any use case currently has at the least 4 to 5 steps to complete) to start using digital as they use cash. I haven't seen product(s) giving them that and hence its an opportunity for all of us to innovate on.
3/24/20, 18:32 - Vikas Business Phone: Thank you FIAKS Maven for supporting social impact initiative with your views
3/24/20, 18:36 - Fintech DBS Amit Jadhav Digibank Sgd NnC: Go to kirana shop, ask them various questions n they'll give more info than you can find under product review. Get 1st hand info about food quality, types or organic fruits theory. He may offer you tea or coffee, if regular customer. 
N while paying, use QR to pay. ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§∂, ‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§∂.
3/24/20, 18:38 - Vikas Business Phone: This not addressing the question sir
3/24/20, 18:40 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: The main issue for which people still prefer cash is the settlement time. Most of the cases it is eother EOD or T+1 or T+2 days. That's why most of them still prefer cash. Why don't we use instant settlement? Like suppose in PhonePe, after a transaction is done, the amount is credited to the merchant's PhonePe account. Then he can withdraw this amount on any PhonePe ATMs. All are happy.
3/24/20, 18:43 - Vikas Business Phone: Please check the question
3/24/20, 18:43 - Vikas Business Phone: Again
3/24/20, 18:43 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: On 1, we have found that sometimes neighborhood shops offer the products at prices that are matching (or even lesser) than the online ones.
3/24/20, 18:44 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: It is possible to get the product within an hour (or even lesser) than wait for a next day (or later) delivery.
3/24/20, 18:45 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Touchy-feely stuff  - obviously there is no beating physical shops
3/24/20, 18:45 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Whatever you do sir, if the acceptance is not there, everything will fail.
3/24/20, 18:45 - Vikas Business Phone: Sir agree
3/24/20, 18:46 - Vikas Business Phone: You can add more
3/24/20, 18:47 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Hyperlocal Aggregation. Then based on the delivery location, the nearest shop may delivery the order within 1-2 hours. Using Uber's H3 and Google's S2 Library this can be done
3/24/20, 18:48 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: There are people doing it üôÇ
3/24/20, 18:48 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Expected üôÉüôÉüôÉ
3/24/20, 18:48 - Vikas Business Phone: This is thought leadetship view
3/24/20, 18:50 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: I still buy all essentials from local shop. They are good and they offer the similar discounts as online shops. Nowadays, they also accept PayTM and UPI payments. Frankly, they have more alternate options and better information then online. Online are good for consumer durables which you have finalised else day to day essentials, my first choice is local store since they provide credit, easily take back the goods and replace if any issue and they are available at least time. In today‚Äôs crisis, online shops stopped deliveries whereas local shops are available and because of repo set up over period , they are not charging premiums.
2. Cash is always good. Since digital payments for Kiran‚Äôs is not good options. Due to fact that when you need to replace the materials, the online shops take more time and they credit after some time. Also, with cash, you get better deals.
3/24/20, 18:51 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
3/24/20, 18:54 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Local shops don't stock a million SKUs, but they don't need to. They have a very good idea of what sells in their area and stocks only such things. Makes it more likely that you fill find what you need right there. So the long tail which online giants flaunt actually has little relevance for these guys as they keep things which give them decent margin and has good demand
3/24/20, 18:57 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Not always. Big brands generally directly procures staff from manufacturers eliminating the middle supply chain. They can provide deep discounts. I always get cheaper rates on packed goods from Bigbasket/Grofers even in Spencers and Bigbazaar. But in loose goods the scenario is little bit different. Also retail chains provides loyalty points and other occasional discounts.
3/24/20, 18:58 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: In today‚Äôs crisis and for last two days, there is no online shops which are delivering day to day essentials. We all are buying Fruits, vegetables, milk etc from local grocers and they supply at the prevailing rates and provides us the idea whether we will get the items tomorrow or not? Calls when they get items in stock. Also, gives credit if we run out of money. This online shopper can‚Äôt offer. 
I strongly believe that the your first relative is called neighbour in this case is Local Grocer.
3/24/20, 19:01 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: What's happening is last few days is not typical. After supplies are empty neither local grocer nor bigbazzar can get supplies as local transport are closed.
Sab Government ke Bharose üôèüôèüôè
3/24/20, 19:21 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: This is one of a example. There are many incidents to quote.üôè
3/24/20, 19:22 - +91 90233 89243: Do you get the quality that your grandfather or your father expects from bigbasket etc?
3/24/20, 19:25 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Yes. Branded goods are same. And Bigbasket branded Goods mostly are better than local Grocer (My Experience)
3/24/20, 19:25 - +91 90233 89243: I see, mine is bit otherwise.
3/24/20, 19:27 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: How can it differ in Branded goods. I dont think Dabur makes different products for different shops. Although I do not prefer to buy Fruits and Veggies from them.
3/24/20, 19:28 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: I don't see a big difference except for convenience...in fact local grocer quality is much different than online...we always uses both ...
Especially for rice , we always prefer a rice trader nearby than online which will be good in quality and pricing
3/24/20, 19:29 - +91 90233 89243: Sorry , i oversighted the branded part but than how can branded be better from local sellers than the big basketers etc?
3/24/20, 19:30 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Currently we mix small kirana too a most as ec don't deliver in time or don't most of the goods....depends more on nearby kirana and department stores as and when they open last four days..
3/24/20, 19:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Actually no. I see online ordered goods generally have a expiry date which is not too far while I choose to buy or not after seeing the local one
3/24/20, 19:31 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Thanks to VCs, Bigbasket can purchase directly from Manufacturers and provide more discount than local grocers. Also loyalty bonus
3/24/20, 19:31 - +91 90233 89243: Yes, thats where seeing, touching and feeling makes more sense, isnt it?

3/24/20, 19:33 - +91 90233 89243: üôÇ, agreed , my comment was on the expiry date  and that if we cud have seen it, it could have been avoided.

3/24/20, 19:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In all consumers goods, it will always be about:

Product assortment

3/24/20, 19:36 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: There are plenty of products with a short expiry period - dairy or baked products for instance. A few weeks at most. Whether we get a product made the previous day or the previous week makes a big difference in how we consume it
3/24/20, 19:36 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: Branded packets are mixed and not the same quality . I mean all the rice or similar are not from the same lot. It comes mix to provide the big discount and so called loyalty bonuses.

3/24/20, 19:39 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community Thought Leader on Importance of  Nearby GROCERIES SHOP & CASH SAYS*

*View 34* founder 

While I never cared online discounts, due to lack of attention in most of the online purchase scenarios, I am now taking a second, to see if there is any discount with specific payment instruments, in recent times, so I can avail some discount, when buying mobile phones etc on flipkart.com/amazon.in.

All this, when things are good, and we are cool, going to office and enjoying over weekends, but I am sure, this will not be the case with many, specifically in these times of Epidemic Covid-19.

Recently, after increase in awareness w.r.t. Covid-19, and after few of the suppliers (who are selling sanitizers) rejected delivering Sanitizers to my pincode in Hyderabad (through amazon/flipkart), I went around medical shops to get my supplies, that reminded me once again, to double ensure purchasing through nearby stores in regular times.

it's is these small medical shops around, that we might have occasionally ignored, are coming to our rescue in current time. 

How much innovative these online marketplaces becomes, and how much they expand their customer base, which is undeniable, a balance of sources has to be maintained, for the Supply chain to sustain, and to be able to fulfill the demand of people who span from Cities to Villages

While I always used to think of how people might transact in a 100% digitized Country, 2004 Tsunami is an eye opener (when we stayed in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, a Coastal Town then), and when I thought to expect 80% to 90% Digitization with 10% to 20% Cash possibility, to handle Natural Calamities/Epidemics etc, despite possible options like Barter System etc, that worked centuries earlier, and may not be a better option, in this financial note centric transaction ecosystem (physical/digital)
3/24/20, 19:53 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on importance of NEARBY GROCERIES SHOP & CASH*


So far *61 VIEWS* received 

We shared few only in participating communities
3/24/20, 20:07 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: I was stuck in Kerala during the 2018 floods. Most calamities are crippling. But there are some, like the floods, where both electricity and network connectivity get blanked out.

The silver lining to this covid episode is that power and connectivity have mostly survived, so far. (Thank God for all those who are working for this behind the scenes). So, unless stopped by law/ security, e/m comm continues to provide great convenience.

But, when all else fails, the humble cash in the wallet and the old store next door only will stand a chance.

We don't yet have the level of resilience, redundancy and reliability in electricity, network and logistics that would make centralized tech heavy solutions dependable enough in times like these.

3/26/20, 11:34 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Future of banking_  *Banking in 2030*

Banks have been facing a crisis of confidence since the financial and economic crash of 2008, says KPMG‚Äôs Peter Rothwell. New technology and changing customer demands mean that, by 2030, that crisis could become existential. Will we need banks in the future‚Äîor just their services?

In the next ten years, he says, banks of all sizes will have to accept that usability, reliability, trust and customer service will be the key differentiators in the sector. Trustworthiness may be harder to earn in a world of apps and platforms devoid of imposing high-street buildings and centuries-old brands, but a new generation of users will expect to see a greater transparency and commitment to cyber security than many banks demonstrate at the moment.

3/26/20, 12:05 - Vikas Business Phone: *IMPORTANT*

 There are reports that due to increased Work From Home , *internet may crash* . Already many European countries have issued guidelines to switch to SD mode on streaming platforms such as Netflix etc. FIAKS community members informed that In your country the issue could be more serious. May be we can do our bit on Whatsapp, to avert a complete collapse. 

1. Stop sending Good Morning images - text could be fine.
2. Stop forwarding Videos.
3. Don't forward huge files.
 4. Dont send corona messages.
5. Try sending only text messages (only if important)

Lots of people are in their homes dealing with Anxiety and depression. FIAKS community of intellectuals says Videos of people in hospitals and dying is not helping them. Unless its helping to make a change would suggest to not pass on such videos cos besides blocking bandwidth its also going to lead to massive Hypertension, Anxiety and Mental health issues which is not needed at this moment.

3/27/20, 07:10 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: That‚Äôs fake news.
3/27/20, 07:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not really. The lockdown is expected to last 6 months or longer, but will relax it a bit over the months. Infact, I believe the Army is expected to be called in to police the streets, if the police forces are overwhelmed. 

Just 3 days in, people are already depressed. 6 months will drive people crazy.
3/27/20, 07:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
3/27/20, 07:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: The lockdown is just buying time for a vaccination / cure. 

The virus wont / cant be eliminated, and will spread fast again, as soon as lockdown is lifted, if too soon.
3/27/20, 07:44 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: If the lockdown is 6 months or so, their will be more deaths due to  reasons other than corona... Depression, social angst, etc... This can be controlled and anything beyond 3 weeks livelihood is a big question mark. Very difficult to do this. It can be a phased lockdown
3/27/20, 07:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What do you think 3 week lockdown will accomplish?

There will be 100s of infected but symptomless carriers around, and as soon as lockdown is lifted, the cycle will repeat. Won‚Äôt it?
3/27/20, 07:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Unless you are making the assumption that at end of 3 weeks, no one has the virus!
3/27/20, 07:47 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: 2 weeks is good enough for symptoms to come out. Hence we can atleast isolate the in fected persons
3/27/20, 07:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The lockdown will have to continue longer. But 3 weeks should contain the  virus to some extent
3/27/20, 07:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Must hear bill gates on ted daily talking on CoVid.
3/27/20, 07:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Even then, thats assuming no one new has caught the virus say 5 days before the lockdown is lifted.
3/27/20, 07:48 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: It should be a partial lockdown. Yesterday I saw a news where people thru stones at policeman. This is the reality in India... People are more worried about livilihood and how to survive...
3/27/20, 07:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Even if 100 people caught the virus midway through the lockdown, they are all still incubating and spreading after the end of the lockdown.
3/27/20, 07:50 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: I agree Ajay... For a common man it's not a big worry... He wants to feed his family and doesn't know how to make his ends meet
3/27/20, 07:51 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: Unfortunately that's the case with 80% of population
3/27/20, 07:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: My personal outlook is bit pessimistic on this. It has to run its course. Slowdown is to buy time for healthcare to avoid clogging the health infrastructure. And to hope for cure / vaccination.
3/27/20, 07:51 - Ezyremit Vishal Kanvaty Nn: We can't afford a social unrest
3/27/20, 07:51 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: You are right. But coming out while u have incubated  will infect more people
3/27/20, 07:52 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Curative drugs are atleast 1 year away (if not 18 months)

3/27/20, 07:53 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The biggest worry if it goes anywhere close to the predicted numbers in India, we wont have infra, med help, ventilators, and anything to support the ailing patients
3/27/20, 07:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not just in India. Everywhere!
3/27/20, 07:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Italy & Spain, already happening
3/27/20, 07:54 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Yep. But India would be much worse with 1.4 bn people and not enuf medical infra
3/27/20, 07:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: India numbers are a joke. Definitely not real numbers, and lot of pneumonia deaths are probably corona related and just dont show in stats because they havnt been tested for it.
3/27/20, 07:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
3/27/20, 07:56 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Fully agree. Very little testing anyways

3/27/20, 08:20 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Don't underestimate, I understand no of testings are less, if not testing, no of deaths are not that high, the way happening in other countries, pneumonia deaths too cannot happen at home, hospitals will register those,
Every pneumonia patients do get reported ,going by the number of deaths is not progressive like other countries, we may come out after this lock down.....for that the current trend should continue...
3/27/20, 08:22 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: We did not get affected by other virus break down like Saars, Spanish flu, dengue or H1N1 like westerners.....somehow we have better immunity than the whites,inspite of poor hospital infra,
Hoping corona too will not harm us much

3/27/20, 09:12 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Lockdown is the only way to reduce the burden on hospitals which otherwise will collapse. The issue is beyond how many people will get affected eventually. It‚Äôs about not allowing it to grow beyond what the hospitals can manage.

3/27/20, 09:26 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: You are going by the Wikipedia data...under British rule we never know what all deaths put under Spanish flu...there was absolutely no record of such huge number of deaths in tamil history, 
  We got huge number of cholera and plaque deaths,even those are not to this extent 
...Secondly I just spoke to a GH Dean of Tamil Nadu , he says that near about 75000 are under home quarantine in TN alone, they are getting monitored very closely, not even a single patient across TN are in ventilator currently, which itself a very good sign, no of deaths reported in TN is only one..
No Pvt hospital can treat any flu like illness, hospital will be shut down, if they found to treat such, this includes even to the corporate hospital like Apollo..
   Let's wait for a week, we will come to know your prediction or mine will come true.....

3/27/20, 14:11 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community thought leader (CXO Banker) is asking* 


*Q1* Can prudent fiscal policy & interest rate management have any meaning when economic activity is almost at a standstill? 

*Q2* Will consumers buy automobiles because the interest rate is very low? Can people fly when there are no flights? Will people go out for dining when there is risk of death? 

*Q3* Will corporates invest in an uncertain future?
3/27/20, 14:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 1 is always a yes, finance and economics always matters, even when exchange of goods and services is less, it still exists

2 and 3 essentially are long term India measures when everybody has gotten an excuse to use them otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have seen 2 and 3 being done. It is sort of smart. India needed liquidity regardless of the scare anyway. Problem is will even this credit go to the actual consumer or will it get usurped by the banks or not passed on
3/27/20, 14:16 - +91 90233 89243: For question 3, futures are always uncertain, isnt it? It can be predicted but still uncertain.
3/27/20, 14:38 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Great questions with no easy answers.
On 
1 - I don't see how throwing out any semblance of a system will help the situation. 
2 - The consumption economy of goods like your automobile example is led by the large salaried class. If life gets back to even something like normal sometime in April, many of these people would have lost much economically and the curtailed expenditures of a month coupled with low interest might encourage spending. Though I suspect the real pickup might only be July or later. As aencdata, uou will be astonished to know that there are people placing online orders for sofa sets and dining tables even yesterday!
3 - I was on a call earlier this week with an investor who was advising startups to batten the hatches and assume that the environent is going to be bad for a period of 12 to 18 months. While the advice was for startups, it appears equally relevant for more established corporates. With all the speculation of a second wind for the virus around winter I expect corporates to be very cautious.

The idea is not to kickstart the economy , but to give some respite to people who have already borrowed.and in the process stop banks from going bust.  
I hope measures for reviving the economy will follow once the shutdown is over. No point doing that now!

*View 14* CXO Banker 

The problem is First - transmission. It does not happen even in relatively "normal" times. Second - when there is no economic activity signaling does not help when the need is immediate help for all economic agents - individuals, businesses & banks. My sense is that the government & the central bank need to open their purse strings massively. These are extraordinary times and orthodox methods & instruments will not work. We are losing critical time in taking action as if it is "business as usual" normal times. There is no time to lose.

3/28/20, 14:55 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *IMPORTANT*  Message from the FIAKS community of intellectual bankers. 

*Dear Customer please avoid visits to bank branches for non-productive work like Passbook updation or balance enquires etc* 

I believe that as a banker, we all are working in most vulnerable places after Doctors & Medical Staffs.

For Bankers the next coming weeks are very critical for  them as various Govt departments will release salaries & pensions to the respective account holders. This will create huge rush in branches other than normal days and *non productive* will create more risks apart from essential services of cash accepting & giving from them. Almost in all rural branches, many customers even don't read their account number properly from their books and in such scenarios, *front desk staffs are forced to receive their passbooks to tell Account Balance*. Hence, it's impossible to keep & maintain social distancing while working in Branches. 

FIAKS Community of intellectual bankers request you to take help of *cashless banking & digital banking* and also encourage others. In case, you are not familiar with digital banking, please take help from your any educated *trusted* persons.  

Do forward this message to the people who visit branches frequently.

3/29/20, 15:20 - Vikas Business Phone: *Why to call it CHINA VIRUS and not Corona Virus*

Wuhan to Shanghai = 839 km
Wuhan to Beijing = 1152 km
Milan from Wuhan= 15000 km
Wuhan to NewYork=15000km
Wuhan to Etli = 8695km
Wuhan to India = 3695 km
Wuhan to Iran = 5667 km
Corona has no effect in nearby Beijing / Shanghai.
But deaths in Italy, Iran, European countries and ruining the world economy...
All business areas of China are safe. *Something is fishy*.

*Tough questions to China*:
 *Q1* Where the whole world is being affected by this, why did it not spread anywhere in China except Wuhan?  How did China's capital remain untouched by this?

 *Q2* Why did China hide from the whole world about the virus?

 *Q3* Why destroyed the initial sample of Corona?

*Q4* Why did the doctor and the journalist who brought it up be silenced?  Has the journalist been exterminated?

*Q5* When other countries of the world asked to share information, why did they not share the information?  Why refuse

*Q6* Why was the Director of WHO used to hide the spread of corona from human to human? 

*Q7* "There is no need to issue any guideline for any international flight, as it does not spread from human to human" .... WHO kept doing this tweet till 11 January.  Why ???  Today it has been proved that corona spreads from human to human‚Ä¶ so why did the WHO lied ????

 *Q8* Why were 50,00,000 people sent from Wuhan "to different parts of the world" without medical examination .. ???

 *Q9* There was a minor case in Italy till 6 February.  Suddenly Chinese 'We are Chinese, not a virus, embrace us.'  Why did the world's tourist destination known as 'City of Love' come to embrace the people of Italy with placards ???

 *Q10* The whole world is looking at China and WHO with suspicion today and wonder if both China and WHO came to praise India on the same day!  Is it a coincidence?.

_The World Health Organization (WHO) is now haunted by a tweet it sent earlier this year when it cited Chinese health officials who claimed there had been no human transmissions of the novel coronavirus within the country yet.The Jan. 14 tweet came less than two months before WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic_

He says 
The way to handle these misuse is to enforce second level velocity check at NPCI. It may not be practical to check creation of UPI handle and it's misuse in real time. These fraudulent handles will receive significant number and amount with in short period. The handles which exceed certain threshold-1 (say x no of transaction of y amount) need to be "verified" UPI handles and beyond threshold-2 should be "ultra verified" (need to define what that is depending upon the requirement) to prevent fraudulent UPI handle being created and large money being collected.

*China Virus(Corona) is a problem but TB is much bigger problem*. The present epidemic pales in comparison to many other epidemics in the past. Sharing few data points that will give some comfort to each one of you. The difference is due to the rapid spread due to ease of international travel. So earlier the areas could be contained, but now there is a suspense as to where all the virus has piggy-backed with the jet-setters.

 I think as per international trading laws - markets can't be shut. I could be wrong but global Financial markets have an agreement to be kept on for international investors to Accesa their funds. 

Community member from the Institutional Banking side would know. I think it also affects your Country rating if markets are shut for long since it technically tantamounts to stopping flight of capital. FIIs will never put money again - leading to a run on the money

*$20 TRILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST CHINA FOR RELEASING A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION CALLED COVID 19* 

*US group says coronavirus is bioweapon*

 A $20 trillion lawsuit has been filed against Chinese authorities in the US over coronavirus outbreak. American lawyer Larry Klayman and his advocacy group Freedom Watch along with Texas company Buzz Photos have filed the lawsuit against the Chinese government, Chinese army, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Director of Wuhan Institute of Virology Shi Zhengli and Chinese army's Major General Chen Wei.

The plaintiffs have sought $20 trillion, which is a bigger amount than China's GDP, claiming coronavirus is the result of a biological weapon prepared by the Chinese authorities.

They have accused China of aiding and abetting death, provision of material support to terrorists, conspiracy to cause injury and death of US citizens, negligence, wrongful death, and assault and battery.

They allege the virus had released from the Wuhan Virology Institute. The plaintiffs stated that the COVID-19 virus was "designed" by China to kill mass populations. Biological weapons were outlawed in 1925 and hence such a biological weapon is a terrorist-related weapon of mass destruction, the lawsuit mentioned.

The American group cites multiple media reports that said that there was only one microbiology lab in China that handled advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus -- in Wuhan. To cover up, the plaintiffs alleged, China linked statements on coronavirus with national security protocols.

Klayman and the plaintiffs also alleged that Chinese doctors and researchers who spoke out about coronavirus and "raised the alarm to the outside world internationally" have been "silenced". They added that such was the desperation of Major General Chen to save herself from the virus that she injected herself and six members of her team with a potential vaccine that was yet to be tested.

They also alleged that all the defendants were working together to perpetuate "international terrorism".

The lawsuit stated that while coronavirus is slow-acting and slow-spreading to be used against a country's military, "it was designed to be used against the general population of one or more of China's perceived enemy nations, such as the United States."

The American plaintiffs also asked for a jury trial against the Chinese defendants.

As of Dec 31st 2019, bank has investment of Rs 19,100 Cr of which high-quality liquid assets stood at Rs 16,300 Cr. The bank has also maintained Tier 1 Capital of Rs 10,200 Crs.

According to Sep-2019 results RBL has a balance with RBI to the tune of Rs 3,600 Crs. Also it has Rs 2,800 Cr as balance with the bank for money at short notice. The number might have slightly deviated by now, but on a baseline, it would have still maintained roughly Rs 5,000 Cr as cash in hand and balances with RBI.

All in all, RBL has liquidity of roughly Rs 33,000 Cr. It needs another 30,000 Cr to cover depositors‚Äô money. For that, it can (easily) sell its Rs 59,635 Cr loan book at a discount of 50% and get the Rs 30,000 Cr for immediate disbursal.

RBL augmented its Tier 1 capital by raising Rs 2,025 Cr via QIP at Rs 351 per share in Dec 2019. In the same quarter RBL raise another Rs 675 Cr via QIP by offering shares at Rs 340 per piece. All in all, RBL Bank looks healthy.

To hide behind Western standards of propriety and exclude this critical data point from bank records seem foolish. Like any non-core data, the individual concerned should have the option not to provide the data if he so chooses, but banks asking for it per se should not be frowned upon.

It can help the banks decide at what time banks should pitch for a personal loan to a customer like for Diwali or during Christmas; whether they should offer interest-bearing products or profit-sharing products etc.

Of course, there have to be strict rules to ensure the information is not used to discriminate or favor any particular group or community, but the idea that we can prevent discrimination by suppressing information is flawed.

What is the basis of loading additional cost on me...

If for example, I have a home loan, or a car loan, or Credit Card dues... And I have a NACH/ ECS mandate for full payment, how can you override that instruction on your own as a bank?

Shared the website and says SBI will be executing the SI debit request and in case it's bounced only than a moratorium on starts 

Our bank( PRIVATE BANK) is telling to call or email and opt for more!! What's the big difference?

*View 6* FINTECH CXO
why customer need to call ? Looks the way private bank has made it difficult and how easy it is for PSU bank customers 

That‚Äôs the difference

*View 7* CXO FINTECH 
Very true. Now to over rule this, need to be handle by own, either by visiting branch or alternate source. 
Even if any customer overrule this by paying thru alternate channel, how banks system will consider this as EMI accepted and will be out of interest burden. it should not like after this moratorium,  customers of PSU banks will be in queue to get this interest load waived off.
I think RBI should be directive towards this EMI moratorium instead just a general instructions.  rule for all banks should be same.

 ~View 6~ is absolutely not correct..‚ùå

He says pls see ease of process between banks and than decide..SBI will do a debit into account - than debit dishonour charges - than reverse it - than make that account block for moratorium. Our bank will get a call/ thru link customer can opt for moratorium - process of all entries saved..So much time / effort saving.

*View 10*  banker Private

It would have been better from Customer point of view to have a uniform approach 
Since it‚Äôs not there, can‚Äôt point out banks for following a different approach. 
Whether the moratorium is beneficial for a customer or not, is entirely dependent on whether his *income is impacted or not*...most of the customers dependent on business income will want moratorium if their business is impacted and customers who are on salary and not having impact may not want it...

*Q1* Name the law which the Trump administration debated over the use of it that dates to the Korean War in the Federal government's response to the pandemic


 *Q2* Which is the country where the court system was shut down and the use of cellphone data to track potential patients was authorized in response to the pandemic?

Q.2 Israel
4/3/20, 15:16 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
4/3/20, 16:12 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint for Q1*

The Act is a United States federal law enacted in 1950
4/3/20, 17:02 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint for Q2*

It is a less populated country of approx nearly 1 crore
4/3/20, 17:34 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint for Q3*

During it's history, the volunteers of this organization have worked in countries like India, China, South Africa,  Thailand, etc
4/3/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 69*

*Q1*  *The Defense Production Act*

The Defense Production Act permits the federal government to impose some control over private industry to ensure the production of material that is deemed necessary for national defense. Here‚Äôs an explanation of the law.

President Trump had avoided using the full force of the law, opting instead to push the private sector to voluntarily address a shortage of critical medical equipment, particularly ventilators.

But later on, he authorized the government to ‚Äúuse any and all authority available under the Defense Production Act‚Äù to commandeer General Motors‚Äô factories and supply chains to produce ventilators.


*Q2*  *Israel*

After effectively shutting down Israel‚Äôs court system in March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the country‚Äôs internal security agency to tap into a previously undisclosed trove of cellphone data to retrace the movements of people who have contracted the coronavirus and identify others who should be quarantined because their paths crossed.


*Q3*   *Peace Corps*

The Peace Corps in the month of March evacuated more than 7,000 volunteers from posts in more than 60 countries, in an effort to prevent them from becoming stranded during the pandemic.

The group, an independent agency of the U.S. government created by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, sends volunteers abroad to help with social and economic development projects.
4/3/20, 18:15 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: On point 2, interestingly on point 2.. Benjamin Netanyahu's bribery case was listed for hearing just before the courts were shut off.. So many people believe that the move was dubious..

4/6/20, 22:13 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community thought leader On possibility of LOCKDOWN EXTENSION* shared his views Anonymous

_He says_ 
As of now the Medical community is going to be evaluated on the basis of number of cases and number of deaths. So the guidance is towards Lockdown - if this means for a *lifetime Lockdown* so be it since there scorecard and evaluation is a function of controlling cases and deaths.

The whole concept that the Economic decisions are being taken by a group of doctors who are extremely risk averse. *See the idea is you will guide basis what u are evaluated on*. So if I am a business guy whichever product that  eventually decides my bonus or promotion I will sell more of that. *Currently the entire medical fraternity is guided by how many deaths they can control right now.*

They are not anticipating the future deaths that Malnutrition poverty will cause by the extension of a Lockdown for months.The moment you make these advisors accountable for the *falling economy* and the subsequent deaths that might occur because of it....they will change their advise.

In a country with 30% population below poverty line....*a Lockdown extension will cause devastation for many generations to come*. 
It's unbelievable when I hear some doctors saying yes Lockdown extension for months you will save people / so the economist asked him that months Lockdown will cause 50 times deaths thru hunger, famine, mal -nutrition and poverty - the response is i dont know all that - I can only comment at the issue at hand right now..

"India produces 70% of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine. 70%!! That's why not just Trump, but 30 other countries are asking India for the drug now to fight COVID19. Ipca Laboratories, Zydus Cadila and Wallace Pharmaceuticals are three big companies producing it. 

India can produce 40 tons of HCQ in 30 days, meaning 20,00,00,000 tablets of 200 mg each. That's enough to supply to every COVID19 affected country in the world in April, and also keep enough reserves for India! 

Each COVID patient needs just 14 tablets in a full course, so 1,42,85,714 patients in the world can be treated with HCG that India produces in just 30 days!! There is enough for years of outbreak in the worst case scenario.

Last year India exported $6.62 billion worth of HCQ and related formulations. There is nothing new happening today. 

Plus, manufacturing can be ramped up too during an emergency."

So, no big deal.

*India can treat entire Universe with its supply. Chill*

4/9/20, 10:16 - Vikas Business Phone: <Media omitted>
4/9/20, 10:33 - +91 90046 19987: Kindly find below the Summary of call with *Mr. P K Basu, Economist, Consultant & Adjunct Professor at ESSEC Asia Pacific Business School, Singapore* hosted by I-Sec Insititutional Equities Team.

*Executive summary:*

*India may come out much stronger relative to expectations once we are through this uncertain period*.
Fundamentals of India have improved basis: 
a) Corporate tax cut and probably lowest taxes wrt new manufacturing units 
b) Reluctance of global and US markets to significantly depend on Chinese exports may lead to shift in global supply chain providing opportunities to India. 
c) India is relatively under-levered relative to world (refer point 1) 
d) Higher export growth in electronics relative to imports during last few years (indicate import substitution is gaining ground), 
e) Substantially lower oil prices (provides automatic stimulus of 1.5% to 2% of GDP) 
f)  Real rates are relative higher with respect to rest of the world providing RBI levers to cut rates further (Global Central Banks have exhausted ammunition to reduce rates further). 


*For details refer below pointer:*

1) Credit growth in UPA 1&2 averaged ~26%. But in last 6 years India has been able to reigned in. Therefore, in last 6 years *while world has been leveraging up India is relatively under-leveraged*. Sovereign bond issue / opening of domestic bond market can help India lever up.

2) In terms of goods exports alone India has gained market share in US (this has accelerated during last two years). Labour market reform making significant progress, Incentives for Electronics additionally rolled out in March, Attractive corporate tax rate for new investment in manufacturing rolled out in Sep-19 should induce substantial amount of investments into shifting of global value chains into India.

China: growth to be lower may even witness a negative growth as there are significant un-utilized capacity. Also, both *global and US markets acceptance to China exports dependency expected to reduce* once we normalize after this crisis.This may bring financial issues in China to resurface.This should too open up opportunity to India. 

3) There is a *justifiable restraint on part of government in rolling out of fiscal package* relative to size what US and some other countries have rolled out. However, when you look at India's public debt to GDP relative to world, India stands better. Therefore, one need not worry on the fiscal and public debt is getting out of control because of loss of revenue due to lockdown. Also, if any of the strategic sale takes place, Oil bounty due to drop in prices (itself is 1.5% to 2% of GDP) and staggered opening up of the economy which has been planned (assuming situation comes under control by end April) should ensure recovery in fiscal coming back. US fiscal stimulus is 10%-11% of GDP. However, US is starting with a 105% of public debt GDP. India's central government debt is restrained around 47% of GDP and all public debt is not more than 60% of GDP.   

4) India is a big importer in electronics and fuel. Interesting difference is *export growth in electronics is higher than import growth* (albiet on a lower base). While Electronics export growth ranged about 35% to 45% a year for last 3 years (commands only 4.5% share in total exports); Imports are declining at 6% to 10% a year (Electronics export are now 35% of imports from being 25%, 2 years earlier). This indicates successful substitution of domestic production for imports.

Oil the benefit is from structurally lower prices. This shall help restrain inflation, which ensures policy rates to trend down. 
This makes India stand out relative to world because other Central Banks have exhausted ammunition to reduce rates further (while they can extend QE). *Real rates in India are relatively higher* wrt world if one were to take WPI inflation to policy rate. Of course there was a spurt in food prices during last 6 months, may be COVID is a blessing to reduce food prices enabling RBI to cut rates further.  
Hide quoted text

5) *Current account position:* CAD in last reported quarter was 0.2% of GDP and in Q4 FY20 there may be a small surplus given sharp decline in oil prices in March. 

6) *INR:* may see stabilization and then strengthening a bit once we are through these uncertain times. Given CAD position is strong and capital will flow back into place like India. 
In the near term, there might be some strengthening of USD. (Expect average USD:INR at 74 for rest of the year)

*Therefore, once recovery begins India shall be big beneficiary.*

*Company* : INVESTCORP

*About report*: Semi-annual fiscal year (H1 FY20) results for the six months ended December 31st, 2019
4/10/20, 14:21 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member shared an interesting read on - UNHACKABLE INTERNET*

An internet based on quantum physics will soon enable inherently secure communication. A team led by Stephanie Wehner, at Delft University of Technology, is building a network connecting four cities in the Netherlands entirely by means of quantum technology. Messages sent over this network will be unhackable.

In the last few years, scientists have learned to transmit pairs of photons across fiber-optic cables in a way that absolutely protects the information encoded in them. A team in China used a form of the technology to construct a 2,000-kilometer network backbone between Beijing and Shanghai‚Äîbut that project relies partly on classical components that periodically break the quantum link before establishing a new one, introducing the risk of hacking.

The Delft network, in contrast, will be the first to transmit information between cities using quantum techniques from end to end.

The technology relies on a quantum behavior of atomic particles called entanglement. Entangled photons can‚Äôt be covertly read without disrupting their content.

But entangled particles are difficult to create, and harder still to transmit over long distances. Wehner‚Äôs team has demonstrated it can send them more than 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles), and they are confident they can set up a quantum link between Delft and the Hague by around the end of this year. Ensuring an unbroken connection over greater distances will require quantum repeaters that extend the network.

Such repeaters are currently in design at Delft and elsewhere. The first should be completed in the next five to six years, says Wehner, with a global quantum network following by the end of the decade.

FIAKS Community thought leader *Mr Ketan Doshi*, Managing Director of PayPoint India, said in the official release: "Our country-wide network of micro-ATMs, installed at grocery shops or mom-and-pop stores, plays an important role in deep interiors. Residents will no longer have to walk long distances to get hold of hard cash. Furthermore, It also helps shop owners avoid the hassle of storing cash or making multiple trips to the banks to deposit their extra cash. It is crucial for micro-ATM penetration in all villages in the country, as most of these areas are the high-cash economy."

The company stated that its O2O network comes into the picture when the low acceptance of digital payments is a challenge in rural areas.

4/12/20, 17:35 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Saw it. Agree to all of the points except one. I am currently working with 2-3 Multispeciality hospitals in Kolkata for our own product development. With my small understanding interacting with doctors and others, I can say that though Telemedicine will make a jump but I am not sure how significantly for the simple procedure of "Clinical Findings". This is the reason, no senior doctors prefer Telemedicine. All test report has printed this line at the bottom "Please Correlate Clinically". Even I saw multiple prescriptions (I was auditing them) where doctors preferred clinical findings over laboratory findings. Though this is my experience. And I will be happy if I am wrong as tele-medicine will grow my business. üôèüôè

4/12/20, 19:25 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Some countries have diagnostic results available online to the referring doctor and patients are able to request for a copy of their prescriptions and diagnostic results when they need it. 

Electronically delivered diagnostics straight to the doctor has many advantages. It eliminates the need for another visit as the doctor can see the results and advise whether a follow up visit is required or not. If a specialist referral is needed then that too can be done electronically.

Some clinics in Canada have started video based consultations. A crisis like this is a great opportunity to establish new paradigms as stakeholders (in this case medicos and Government) are open to accepting solutions that may involve a paradigm change.
4/12/20, 19:34 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: What I understood from interaction with 70+ doctors (that includes my father too) is, any Experienced and Senior Doctor relies mostly on Clinical findings. Lab tests are secondary. Digital Test delivered to EMR software is nothing new. But it's a complementary process. Some exceptions are follow up consultations for Chronic Diseases like Diabetes, Thyroid etc. But for most of the cases Clinical Examination plays a Vital Role in any diagnosis. If a doctor takes HCG test as conclusive test for pregnancy he will missout a probable tumor which is not very good for the patient.
4/12/20, 19:55 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: üëç clinical examination has its own place and is probably irreplaceable for the foreseeable future

4/13/20, 19:11 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FIAKS community member shared info on ‚ÄúHYPER-PERSONALIZED MEDICINE‚Äù*

_Genetic medicine tailored to a single patient means hope for people whose ailments were previously uncurable_.


Here‚Äôs a definition of a hopeless case: a child with a fatal disease so exceedingly rare that not only is there no treatment, there‚Äôs not even anyone in a lab coat studying it. *‚ÄúToo rare to care,‚Äù goes the saying.*

*That‚Äôs about to change, thanks to new classes of drugs that can be tailored to a person‚Äôs genes*. If an extremely rare disease is caused by a specific DNA mistake‚Äîas several thousand are‚Äîthere‚Äôs now at least a fighting chance for a genetic fix.

One such case is that of Mila Makovec, a little girl suffering from a devastating illness caused by a unique genetic mutation, who got a drug manufactured just for her. Her case made the New England Journal of Medicine in October, after doctors moved from a readout of her genetic error to a treatment in just a year. They called the drug milasen, after her.

The treatment hasn‚Äôt cured Mila. But it seems to have stabilized her condition: it has reduced her seizures, and she has begun to stand and walk with assistance.

Mila‚Äôs treatment was possible because creating a gene medicine has never been faster or had a better chance of working. The new medicines might take the form of gene replacement, gene editing, or antisense (the type Mila received), a sort of molecular eraser, which erases or fixes erroneous genetic messages. What the treatments have in common is that they can be programmed, in digital fashion and with digital speed, to correct or compensate for inherited diseases, letter for DNA letter.

How many stories like Mila‚Äôs are there? So far, just a handful.

But more are on the way. Where researchers would have once seen obstacles and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù they now see solutions in DNA and think maybe they can help.

The real challenge for ‚Äún-of-1‚Äù treatments (a reference to the number of people who get the drug) is that they defy just about every accepted notion of how pharmaceuticals should be developed, tested, and sold. Who will pay for these drugs when they help one person, but still take large teams to design and manufacture?
4/13/20, 20:03 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community Thought leader raises a question on GDP LOSS IN THIS LOCKDOWN period. He says* 

I studied following data point from some group post and then validate the authenticity

1. Total  GDP of India is close 200 lac crores. 
2. Lets assume that during Lockdown we are functioning at 40% efficiency which is itself in higher side. 
3. Lets assume after opening of structured lock down, the efficiency recovery happens over 3 months. 
‚ñ™Ô∏èMonth 1 - 60 %, 
‚ñ™Ô∏èMonth2  - 70% 
‚ñ™Ô∏èMonth 3 - 85%.

4. Now calculate the 4 months GDP loss
*A*. 39 days : 200 * 39/365 * .60 = 12.82 Lac crores

*B*. Next 30 days : 200*30/365 * .40 = 6.57 Lacs crores

*C*. Next 30 days : 200*30/365* .30 = 4.90 Lacs crores

*D*. Next 30 days : 200*30/365* . 15 = 2.45 Lacs crores

*Total GDP loss = 28.12 Lac crores*

This amount is -*14 percent negative GDP growth*. While Economist are saying India will grow atleast 1 to 2.5 percent.ü§î

I want to understand what is wrong with above math. If we assume math is right then is it not moving to  deep Depression cycle. Please clarify since I am not an economist and in this situation, I would love to be wrong in my calculations.
4/13/20, 20:31 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on GDP LOSS in LOCKDOWN*

*View 1* CXO BANKER 
I think what this maths doesn't consider is the subsequent months, non essential ex shopping should bounce back items like clothing/ jewellery / travel HV only been pushed for later. Lets assume 3 more months are left and demand surges at 30% in those, what will be the net impact? I will go with the 1-2.5%. I think this is where the naysayers are getting it wrong. Beauty of essential services is agricultural output stays as it is, conspicuous consumption takes a hit but will bounce back in certain categories with a vengeance. 

*View 3* CXO FINTECH 
So the cumulative effect of all this needs to be taken into consideration, in my mind this is not a proper depression since this is force stopped rather than a gradual decline of economic activity. You need people to harvest agri. If migrant labour has gone back to their villages and can't travel, then the produce will rot. Add social distancing to this whole mix

*View 4*
So not sure if traditional definitions of depression apply. Selling in mandis is another challenge

*View 5*
Was agriculture done by migrant labourü§îü§î maybe large scale ones. I see a lot of government facilitation too. Export is an area am genuinely worried about. Just take the micro category of Alphonso mangoes farmers might sell it off to domestic, middlemen will perish

 I feel this will slow down growth but not lead to degrowth

*View 8*
that's a nano-category üòÉ Not required for sustenance, not bought by FCI, government doesn't announce MSP nor maintain buffer stocks

Shouldn‚Äôt point A be 30 days 
(Guess 9 days are of previous FY). If I am correct then I have restored about 3 l crores of GDP üòÉüòÉüòÉ

*View 16* _Serial Entrepreneurs_
Assumptions are wrong... A) it assumes that GDP is equally distributed across months which is not true b) second it also assumes that GDP is one variable but GDP consists of 3 things i.e consumer spends, govt spends and net exports. While assumption may be true for first component, govt spends and net exports are not factored in working. Govt spends will increase rather and net export is not known.. hopefully it will be better due to oil prices and lesser import from China
GDP numbers are higher in second half of the year compared to first so definitely not equally distributed. He shared below image 

*View 19*  _Founder_
2.7 trillion is GDP. As per Arvind S. So make the following changes in math. I am assuming  a steep drop post Feb. So not V.  We are at bottom of the L. So drop is down to 15-25% range in first month. 30% second, and 50% third. It will take a good. 2 - 4 quarters to get back to some semblance of normalcy.

And several years for India to re tool and deliver back to 5% growth. Let alone 8%> I hope i am wrong. But this is my sixth exogenous economic  experience.

*_Potential impact of the Covid-19 on the Indian economy_*
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected more than eight hundred thousand people in more than 150 countries1 - a scourge confronting all of 
humanity, impacting lifestyles, businesses, economies, and the assumption of common well-
being that all of us have largely taken for granted.The situation has now been 
aggravated by the demand, supply and liquidity shocks that COVID-19 has inflicted. Once the pandemic is controlled, the shape and speed of the recovery in the US and China will be key factors determining the nature and traction of global economic recovery.This insight highlights the fact that the economic recovery in India will be smoother and faster than that of many other advanced countries.

*Covid-19, cash, and the future of payments*

_Key takeaways of report_
‚Ä¢ The Covid-19 pandemic has fanned public concerns that the coronavirus could be transmitted by cash.
‚Ä¢ Scientific evidence suggests that the probability of transmission via banknotes is low when compared with other frequently-touched objects, such as credit card terminals or PIN pads.
‚Ä¢ To bolster trust in cash, central banks are actively communicating, urging continued acceptance of cash and, in some instances, sterilising or quarantining banknotes. Some encourage contactless payments.
‚Ä¢ Looking ahead, developments could speed up the shift toward digital payments. This could open a divide in access to payments instruments, which could negatively impact unbanked and older consumers. The pandemic may amplify calls to defend the role of cash ‚Äì but also calls for central bank digital currencies.

4/14/20, 23:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Lot of firings but no one is reporting them. This was going to happen so it is not surprising but it‚Äôs a little weird that there is no news about these things.
This is when the country is just under 20 days of lock down and another 20 to go, with possibility of at least another 20-50 days further in my limited understand.

Either we are severely underestimating then overall economic problem, or worse, we know but we won‚Äôt talk about it.
4/14/20, 23:44 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Totally agree
4/15/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Did a very small badly sampled unscientific polling across 6 entrepreneurial WhatsApp groups and within just last one hour the number is at 127 companies and the total sample size of people active seems to be at 500 (late night), caution being this might be over-represented by Bangalore at the moment, which statistically speaking would actually mean higher for Mumbai / Delhi / Pune / Hyderabad / Chennai / Calcutta, if polled more scientifically.
4/15/20, 01:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can deduct anywhere between 20-30-50%  in terms of companies being common, depending upon how you want to view the data
4/15/20, 01:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However directionally its very clear
4/15/20, 01:07 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Does this relate to the above point you made earlier?
4/15/20, 01:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes
4/15/20, 01:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The question was secret firings etc
4/15/20, 01:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The polling group is between 22 and 35
4/15/20, 01:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Total respondents are about 40-50
4/15/20, 01:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Directionally this doesn‚Äôt look good, we are just 20 days or so in the lockdown
4/15/20, 01:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Secret? Lol
4/15/20, 01:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indian entrepreneurs assume if they fire and ask people to sign documents then employees won‚Äôt talk
4/15/20, 01:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In UK, estimate seems to be 5-7% by year end. 
In US, close to 10%.
4/15/20, 01:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I don‚Äôt even want to.....
4/15/20, 01:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Extremely low numbers, will need readjustment for sure.
4/15/20, 01:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: <Media omitted>
4/15/20, 01:10 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: The same however is not only a function of Indian Economy. Likely more to do with funding.
4/15/20, 01:11 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: That is likely more because of the global economy.
4/15/20, 01:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes I have not dived into that piece yet
4/15/20, 01:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: To my limited understanding, this hasn‚Äôt shown up in the data yet
4/15/20, 01:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: The stress is palpable. If the developed countries sneeze, we get viral fever in india. üòÇ
4/15/20, 01:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This will show up later, not even in May, possibly in June
4/15/20, 01:12 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: https://www.livemint.com/news/india/imf-projects-india-to-be-fastest-growing-major-economy-11586870380725.html
4/15/20, 01:12 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Squeeze on funding
4/15/20, 01:12 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: ?
4/15/20, 01:13 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: India likely to be still the fastest growing economy
4/15/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes relatively India will still be the fastest growing
4/15/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs not a doubt
4/15/20, 01:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Maybe coz more western companies will Cut local jobs & outsource to India, to cost cut? üòÅ
4/15/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However that data point doesn‚Äôt really affect this discussion in the short term
4/15/20, 01:14 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Stress where? Contraction in GDP is estimated to be much higher in European countries.
4/15/20, 01:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Ok let‚Äôs not turn this into a nationalism battle, I am sure we are all wise enough
4/15/20, 01:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Stress in EU/US will trickle down to India, as well.
4/15/20, 01:15 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Relative. But also I think India and China is estimated to be the only +be growing economy. Every other will contract.
4/15/20, 01:15 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: No. Nationalism battle. Not sure the point you are making.
4/15/20, 01:15 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: *+ve
4/15/20, 01:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Total jobs in an economy is not a matter of relative growth but absolute growth
4/15/20, 01:15 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Understood. There is an economic impact. There is no doubt.
4/15/20, 01:16 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: But job loess will be higher in countries where GDP will contract. So not understanding the point bing made.
4/15/20, 01:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ‚ÄúFebruary 2020, pre-coronavirus pandemic and national lockdown, about 40.4 crore Indians were employed, as per the CMIE report for the month. At that point, 3.4 crore were unemployed.

Compare these to the figures from last week. The CMIE estimates that only 27.7 per cent of the working-age population (103 crore) was employed in the week after lockdown began. That works out to 28.5 crore. So, within two weeks, the number of gainfully employed has come down from 40.4 crore to 28.5 crore, a drop of 11.9 crore. ‚Äú
4/15/20, 01:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs not what I am trying to understand at all, I am not trying to check absolute or percentage decline in total jobs of other countries at all
4/15/20, 01:18 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: This is correct. The point being? Lockdown should be lifted?
4/15/20, 01:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am just trying to understand India only impact
4/15/20, 01:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If US has more job loss as a % relative to job loss % in India has no bearing on total absolute job loss number in India (in this instance)
4/15/20, 01:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Just shared, in context of discussion! Not implying anything.

Tho, does lifting lockdown mean lost jobs will be revived? Doubt it.
4/15/20, 01:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes so that‚Äôs why I said let‚Äôs not make it political or Nationalistic
4/15/20, 01:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Based on this article, its above 25%! And probably only formal sector counted.
4/15/20, 01:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Lockdown lifting or not is not something for us to decide
4/15/20, 01:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We are only looking at data from the point of data
4/15/20, 01:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Assuming we know nothing of inputs, just outputs
4/15/20, 01:20 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Here you said that we are severely understimatinv the economic problem or worse, we know but we won‚Äôt talk about it. 

Not sure who are you referring to as we.
4/15/20, 01:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Meant founders / employees, not government
4/15/20, 01:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Government has no role in this
4/15/20, 01:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We are just trying to make sense of the data that exists or is collected
4/15/20, 01:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Govt can boost businesses to reduce firings. Tho, in Indian scenario, highly probe to fraud.
4/15/20, 01:23 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Right. Understood. Possibly the social thing to do. But report after report are highlighting the negative impact on the economy. And particularly in startups there is the added dimension of funding. So job loss is imminent.
4/15/20, 01:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: prone*
4/15/20, 01:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes true but we are trying to hide all this under rugs
4/15/20, 01:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yeah. From business owner perspective, its either firings or bankruptcy!
4/15/20, 01:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As if wishing it away is a solution
4/15/20, 01:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Tough to do in India
4/15/20, 01:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Paying money direct to citizens is least effective way to boost economy. Its short term survival. Not sustainable.
4/15/20, 01:27 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Guess will follow the order of. No increments. No bonus -> Cuts -> Job losses in terms of media reporting
4/15/20, 01:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes possible
4/15/20, 01:28 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Hopefully India will benefit. From the changes in income tax. And cut in corporate tax done earlier.
4/15/20, 01:28 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Round of news on no increments. No bonus is done.
4/15/20, 01:29 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Now noticing salary cuts news
4/15/20, 01:29 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Possibly soon to follow job loss
4/15/20, 01:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its such a nightmare.
World War 3, pretty much! Just not physical war. üôà
4/15/20, 01:29 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Nothing short of a war!

4/15/20, 01:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: One of the topics was Bio + Cyber, dual attack.

If there is any connection between Wuhan Lab & Zoom, both being Chinese, this is actually following a predictef pattern.

Then I realised that it is under the name of XYZ finance Ltd( NBFC). When investigated I came to know it is because of Wallet postpaid. I have never consciously subscribed to it. However I've not utilised a single penny out of the same postpaid account. But it's a concern here as it is adding to my account as total value borrowed. 

Isn't that a grave concern that tomorrow ABC postpaid and your postpaid telecom bill started getting reported to bureau? it might affect anybody's score card!! 

P.s.: I'm not able unsubscribe the wallet postpaid. It‚Äôs really very difficult

4/15/20, 19:35 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: That's really unsettling. I know many youngsters who have no loans and are in the first months/year of their career who cheerfully use several postpaid wallets. If it is treated as a loan and the users are not sensitized to how it affects their credit score, they could start their financial journey in the red and get shut out of the mainstream for no good reason!

4/15/20, 20:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Thats how it should be. IMHO, credit history should be based not just on card and bank accounts, but any postpaid bill, including mobile & utility. Non-payment of bills is true indicator of someones credit worthiness.
4/15/20, 20:36 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on Concerns on CREDIT BUREAU*

_Kindly note select response is shared only in participating communities_

*View 1*
It is a line credit....in TnC fine print when u may have subscribed to Wallet. You need to write to NBFC and discontinue. They will report it to Bureau and correct it.

*GENUINE CONCERN* Still it's a lot of effort to get it removed. How can I read font size 8 term & conditions running into several pages. This is unacceptable. 

*View 4* CXO banker 
It's surprising that this is showing unless the person has agreed to the postpaid facility... Till then it's an offer, and cannot be counted under credit facilities to the person...

*View 6* CXO NBFC
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong in reporting postpaid bill payment to bureau ( Infact Vodafone has tied up wit bureaus to decide whom to give a postpaid connection and whom not and also for enhancing credit limit) This info will come in handy for lenders who give short term small ticket loans..any postpaid service payment  which is electricity, landline, mobile, rent payment should be reported and should attract positive and negative score

The genuine concern here is if the individual has not taken any postpaid service of wallet then he should not have any impact on bureau score.

*View 9* CXO tech
This is really a problem. Incorrect way to show lending. It should be based on actual loan taken not based on such wallets. There are thousands of wallets which we subscribe. So there is no control and we don‚Äôt use these very frequently.
4/15/20, 21:13 - Vikas Business Phone: Members, We received *18 post* on the question raised so far. 

Shared few responses only with  *Participating communities* 

we will incorporate the rest in *FIAKS BESPOKE* report.
4/15/20, 21:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I think general mindset in India is that credit worthiness = loans. 

So, if its not a loan, its ok to not pay back without affecting credit worthiness? ü§î

By definition, any service where you don‚Äôt pay upfront is credit. So, it should affect credit. 

Whether you utilise credit or not, as long as you been approved for credit, it should be on your credit report, right?
4/15/20, 21:47 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I think this principle is valid and that's how it should be. I believe there is a critical need to sensitize users about the implications. Someone takes an Ola postpaid subscription without much thought of it being credit. While I agree people should not be intending to take that service and not pay and hence any default should logically affect the credit score. But then wouldn't it amount to mis-selling if a credit product is being pushed that aggressively, almost non-stop to every user, and everyone is allowed to sign up willy-nilly? I think there is a clear lack of responsibility in this so-called lender that should reduce/eliminate the impact on the user's. Even postpaid telco accounts take deposits and significant KYC (incl a visit to the customer's house) and hence there is a certain process of acquisition that prevents mis-selling and hence they are not equivalent to click-through sign-ups for postpaid wallets.

Over the past few weeks, Zoom‚Äôs market cap has risen to $32 billion and Yuan‚Äôs personal wealth is now estimated to be $6.48 billion, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Billionaire index.

In 1997, Yuan was hired as a software engineer at a small video conferencing company called WebEx. In 2007, the firm WebEx was acquired by Cisco Systems for $3.2 billion. Yuan rose to the rank of Vice President before he left Cisco in June 2011.

‚úÖ extention of resolution timeline- in case of large accounts under default an additional provision  of 20% required if not completed in 210 days, recognition the challenges   further 90dyas has been added for resolution

‚úÖ divided - *the SCB shall not make any dividend payout for FY20,- this will be reviewed in Q2Fy21*

‚úÖ for LCR - *it has been lowered to 80% from 100% from immediate effect* - this will be ramped up in phased manner 1st october 2020 90% and 100% by FY22

The coronavirus pandemic has struck at the very heart of what makes sales organizations tick. Sales leaders are asking: What should we do now to keep our field-sales organization safe and productive? And what does this mean for the future of selling?

The answers vary across industries, as captured vividly by a recent Goldman Sachs headline, ‚ÄúLight at the End of the Tunnel or an Oncoming Train? Depends on Where You Are Standing.‚Äù Some industries, such as transportation, hospitality, and real estate, have suffered immensely and are facing an existential crisis. Others, such as teleconferencing, online learning, and virtual private networks (VPNs), are experiencing a sharp upturn in demand. In between, most industries are experiencing a demand slump. The direct and knock-on effects are continuing to reverberate through companies and industries.

4/18/20, 19:02 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS CSR vdo_ *10th Apple Effect*

One of the FIAKS Community Industry Evangelist who is a Founder of Fintech Company had his 50th birthday which is generally celebrated with Big Bang by all of us as it a major milestone. However, due to lock down it was not possible. So he did a simple calculation that even if 100 people would have attended his birthday it would mean an expense of Rs 5 Lakhs.

Looking at the bad situation of the migrants in the country, which shook him...  he decided to donate  *Rs 500,000* amount to feed the migrants in these camps. He wrote to all his friends including FIAKS to send him a gift in form of cash which has created another large kitty which is again getting donated to feed migrant worker. This is what we call *THOUGHT LEADERSHIP*

I am sure every one of you are doing something  to support the people in this time of crisis. Even if you decide forego one dinner party a month ie  Rs 2500/- per month. You are creating a large kitty of Rs 30,000 per annum which can be used for better purpose.  I am hoping this simple math makes some decisions appear so easy... *Isn‚Äôt it ?*

Here is another _FIAKS vdo_ *10th Apple Effect* which provides a great guidance to us. It helps us better understand appreciation for simple gift of life using *Law of Diminishing Gratitude* Let's stop taking things for granted. 

_Also do listen to the experience of Italian person on ventilator in this vdo_

Community Member says *Brent is not, it's only WTI.*


*FAB Query* what is BRENT

Brent refers to oil that is produced in the Brent oil fields and other sites in the North Sea. Brent Crude's price is the benchmark for African, European, and Middle Eastern crude oil. The pricing mechanism for Brent dictates the value of roughly two-thirds of the world's crude oil production.

*What is WTI*

West Texas intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas light sweet, is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light crude oil because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content.

4/21/20, 00:48 - Vikas Business Phone: It's phenomenon called 'Backwardation'. 

*FAB query* what does Backwardation mean?

*Response*
Basically it is due to higher production and very low demand. At the same time cost of storage and carrying the oil is expected to be higher than price of oil for that time period. Until there is visibility of demand and opening of economies will be there, such pricing may become normal atleast for short term to compensate for higher production in last few months.

4/22/20, 09:22 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: Concurrent with the investment, Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail Limited (‚ÄúReliance Retail‚Äù) and WhatsApp have also entered into a commercial partnership agreement to further accelerate Reliance Retail‚Äôs New Commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp. WhatsApp already plays an important role in helping people and businesses connect in India. Reliance Retail‚Äôs New Commerce platform, JioMart, is being built in partnership with millions of small merchants and kirana shops to empower them to better serve the needs of Indian consumers. The companies will work closely to ensure that consumers are able to access the nearest kiranas who can provide products and services to their homes by transacting seamlessly with JioMart using WhatsApp.

4/22/20, 09:54 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member is asking FACEBOOK 43,574 cr investment in  RELIANCE JIO*

Q1 Why does Reliance need Facebook to offer financial services in India? What's app like chatting application can easily developed by any company for less than 1 million USD. Isn't it? is this MAKE IN INDIA??

Q2 Also Google Pay is allowed in India then  why WhatsApp entry was restricted?. Was this partnership only option left with  whatsapp to make an entry into India into payment space?

Q3 Does that mean any chatting application like Viber, telegram etc can make 9.99% investment in payments bank and start offering financial services ?
4/22/20, 10:04 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: The way we are moving forward, all so called Unicorns will be acquired by foreign entities. Flipkart, Paytm, OYO etc have foreign majority stakeholder. It's kind of expected when 100% FDI is legal. It's like putting a development centre in India to get workforce.
That's very unfortunate.

4/22/20, 11:50 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: Some may have thought that a global pandemic like Covid-19 would bring the world together but in fact the opposite may be happening. Existing geopolitical tensions are worsening and looking ahead, there is little doubt that the crisis will fundamentally alter the geopolitical landscape. Countries that emerge from the crisis relatively unscathed ‚Äì a list that will hopefully include India ‚Äì may find themselves in a position of relative strength. The opposite may be true for those, such as America, that have mishandled it.

These, and many other dimensions of the geopolitical fallout of Covid-19, were explained by Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, Foreign Editor at the Hindustan Times, at recent webinars of IMA‚Äôs India CEO and CFO Forums. The attached conclusions paper summarises these discussions.

4/22/20, 16:02 - +91 90046 19987: Recieved in my other whatsapp group  - Implications for Indian Digital and Payments ecosystem :

- Mr. Ambani spoke about leveraging Jio and WhatsApp to drive digitisation of 30 million SmE retailers or Kiranas. Would possibly mean WhatsApp pe / Jio becomes the mode of getting orders and payment vehicle. possible Micro ecosystem depending upon geographic area.

- Whatsapp is stuck at a pilot stage with 10 mn where as India has around 300-350 million whatsapp users.

This will possibly push WhatsApp Pay move from Pilot to full scale launch. Presently WhatsApp Pay is P2P on UPI however the opportunity for P2M and network cards being source of funds is not a far off scenario

- Massive push to P2P & small ticket P2M transactions.

Salaries of Help, Drivers, Home delivery, conversion of cash on delivery, Kirana payments as immediate used cases to drive growth

- Jio Enroute to become the super app possibly integrating WhatsApp and other elements Jio already has on lines of Wechat Pay. Build its own ecosystem of payments

*View 23* Wallets like Paytm Mobikwik, Oxigen, Itzcash, Freecharge and many other *created market, educated customers, invested in this market* by spending billion in form cash back and other ways. Whats the status of these *MAKE IN INDIA* brands? 

Wait and watch..what is going happen to the home grown banks in the next 3 years with WhatsApp entry... PLS DO SAVE THIS MESSAGE for review in 2023

*View 35*
I think there‚Äôs more than meets the eye:
FB had pitched for ‚Äúfree basic internet‚Äù some years back in india ( _so ISPs should invest in bandwidth creation, leaving the profits with FB_).

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhatsapp has been ‚Äúsummoned‚Äù in recent past for data privacy issues.
‚ñ™Ô∏èData is the new Oil.
‚ñ™Ô∏èReliance is arguably the most powerful group in India, with ambitious plans for RJio.Just connecting the dots ...

*View 36*
*_Another community members make its further easy understand as under_*

FB needs a fat pipe so it can conquer the data world ... with least worry about *LAWS OF THE LAND* . RJio offers the pipe, and a ‚Äúprotective cover‚Äù ... and of course, the *readymade customer base*.

In turn RJio saves itself from the effort (at least 2 years) of creating social networking and messaging solutions and competing with FB etc, like WeChat in china.


_Great responses to the question posted in the morning.Sharing couple of the best responses from CXO. Rest will be covered as part of *FIAKS Bespoke REPORT*_
4/22/20, 22:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: A large part of jio users are the ‚Äúemerging part of india - Bharat‚Äù.  The ones who are aspirational; buying fashion and apparel online, consuming huge amount of content and playing games. 
- Underlying Jio runs free (read, ad-based) plethora of services - entertainment, music, video, games, news n magazines, payments, health, ecommerce. 

This makes Jio sit on a landmine of user data who are poised to consume, use and spend money - today primarily on ecommerce. 

They know what people are watching, what they are buying, how they are paying, what are their habits. Now multiply this with the power of people‚Äôs connected social network and all other aspects of FB 
Thats exactly Facebooks interest! :)
4/22/20, 22:41 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: They know who people are talking to, where they stay, where they work, what they surf, who they get SMS from (proxy of their service providers - banks, mutual funds, DTH, electricity), what their age is and so much more based on telco behaviour and KYC
4/22/20, 22:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Absolutely!
4/22/20, 22:44 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Telco data in itself has been such an under utilizes abd under monetized area. If there are legit ways to combine the data it can be so much more powerful. And I hope it is done only in legit ways üòõ
4/22/20, 22:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
data is new oil. personally, i am not for exploiting customer data, without strict guidelines and checks.
4/22/20, 22:48 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Well Telcos have always found a way. Earlier it was as Vas, then it moved ‚Äúsyndicated‚Äù ways of messaging and now may be thru their services. Its easy to make it ‚Äúlegit‚Äù by just making the user accept a inconspicuous TnC by a seemingly harmless button. 
Unless there is a Cambrige Analytica kind of a telco led disaster, people may not understand what kind of privacy breaches they are under and what they are signing up for (almost blindly)
4/22/20, 22:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: being a payment gateway, we have so much data of customers of particular kind of merchants..

for eg. we process for several nutra and health merchhants, similar to healthkart. i could easily start a competing brand, and promote offers to customers of these merchants..

telco or any service provider monetising user data is very similar to that.. isnt it
4/22/20, 22:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: especially when there is connflict of interest like this.. internet provider + service provider joining hands..
4/22/20, 22:51 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Agree. But running services (like an ajio) gives them the extra fuel. What did i buy and didn‚Äôt buy (my preferences), what i looked at but turned down (my choices). Am i buying for myself or for someone else (my social graph) and there is so much more
4/22/20, 22:57 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: If a telco/isp does deep packet inspection they will know everything about the customer.
4/22/20, 22:57 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: One could almost have an ethtical/unethical debate on what when and how much consumer data should be taken, how and where it should reside, and what can companies do with the data and  their partners access to that. And while G/FB have pioneered  the free model monetised thru data, is it better to pay for services - to buy your own privacy!!
And guess there is no right or one answer to this.
4/22/20, 22:58 - Vikas Business Phone: Do you see any future for Payments business now..


Will Payment gateways/tech platform survive ?
4/22/20, 22:59 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: I did not mean competing with service providers. But monetizing the data itself. E.g. a much more potent DMP and effective customer targeting. Or say creating a credit score for lenders as a service. All with customer consent
4/22/20, 23:00 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Logically payments could run as a horizontal across all jio services providing FB a lot of insights and jio avenues to financial services opportunities, if they hve an appetite for it

4/23/20, 04:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
4/23/20, 04:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: One of major reasons I grew frustrated working in the telco and talking a lot of stuff but nothing moved past the CXOs and SVPs because of bad KPI management and age bias and therefore ended up leaving at quite a good juncture
4/23/20, 07:34 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: In think that was a good reason a lot of who initially worked in telcos move out üòú

But another problem that plagues telcos is ‚Äúmothership‚Äù. The core telco business should not suffer mindset. Without having the vision that being a dump pipe has a limited shelf life. The way telcos monetised a decade back will not be the same today and will dramatically change in the next decade.

Government acted quickly and put forward a program of Rs 1.75 lakh crore of disbursement which started reaching beneficiaries bank account thanks for *JAM (Jan-Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile)* trinity. Up to here, all was well. The problem starts from here. Money has reached bank accounts, but the country has 155,000 Bank branches and 210,000 ATMs as on Dec 2019. Of these ATMs, about 113,000 ATMs are ‚ÄúOn-Site‚Äù ATMs (ATM that are housed with-in a Bank Branch Premise) and only 97,000 ATMs are ‚ÄúOff-Site‚Äù ATMs (ATMs that are located away from Bank premises).

When banks can give 100 crore loan to SME then why can‚Äôt take exposure on credit card spending by the employee of SME?

The thing is companies don‚Äôt want to guarantee its staff spending unless it‚Äôs an approved expense. Companies want all liabilities to staff. Then its better staff takes the card directly without any involvement of the institution.

_FIAKS community member is asking can someone tell us   what *BANKS have done to help Start-ups ?* during the Pandemic so far. Is it that  all start-up programs of Private and MNC banks were only with an objective to open  their current / business account?_






IMPORTANT‚è©
*Kindly note*:  _we will share one or two best responses only in Participating communities.Rest can be read in the FIAKS bespoke which will be released later incorporating all the views_
4/27/20, 20:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This should go into Comedy Channel
4/27/20, 20:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I thought we said no jokes
4/27/20, 20:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There can be so many memes on this topic
4/27/20, 20:21 - Vikas Business Phone: Please share
4/27/20, 20:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Well the first joke is that the only people who took the bank startup program seriously were the bank‚Äôs program managers running those startup programs
4/27/20, 20:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Actually that‚Äôs not true, I don‚Äôt think even they took it seriously, but must have been a good break from the regular mundane bank work that happens in Indian banks
4/27/20, 20:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also might helps to move into Fintech or some other program management job at a large company / help career shifts

Anonymous Shared 

Bank helping start-up ü§£. 
This should go into Comedy Channel. I thought we said no jokes here.

*View 6* CXO banker 

Are we saying that Banks should have one more responsibility... That of helping Start-ups... In addition to all the other things...

*View 7* Forward banker 

Most important example, when a Bank started its accelerator program, the objective was to democratize banking and payments through APIs, opening current and salary accounts is just one thing. Plenty of Fintechs have taken more than advantage of Yes Bank Technology stack.
*Response*: Is this what start-ups looking for now ? ü§£

*View 8*  Banker is asking -
Give us an example that will help define  what help is to be given to start-up 
*Response* They don‚Äôt even know what help start-up needs during this pandemic
4/27/20, 21:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You will end up fundamentally questioning - What does banking do in India?

You see when bankers are recruited they generally don‚Äôt look into what is it that banking should do.

If you look at a market like US, it will be clear about what the difference is.

Banking is meant as a B2C function as holding for safety and for transacting but the real money spinner for banking is B2B money lending, esp B2B SME lending, and then providing them options to grow their money - this function in India was never learnt, never taught, never preached, never practiced, never done at scale - And when done, done mostly via who-knows-who plutocratic nepotism + where bank manager asses by kaju/kismis/daru parties

This is unfortunately governments / RBI / regulatory authority fault more than banks themselves because let‚Äôs not forget India till very recent times in banking terms was 100% nationalised banks, the long lunch breaks and holidays might have gone away in private banking but the psychology and ethos of the same hasn‚Äôt.

4/27/20, 21:45 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I slightly disagree here. 

Core banking operations across US and India are not very different. 

Have banks globally created platforms that have given startups a run for their money. Not really. 

Have banks innovation (not acquisitions) thrown startups out of business. Not much. 

Have banks collaborated with startups across the world. Again miniscule examples. 

It is startups who are disrupting banking - globally. 
It is startups that are scaring banks to collaborate and add value to the ecosystem. 
The only thing that goes against startups today is the support from
Regulatory and banking ecosystem that clip their wings. 

The point is that in most country‚Äôs, the banks legacy, trust and power with local regulators have creAted a string lobby and stifles startups to grow further. And wherever things have changed is because the government has worked extensively to have startups work with regulations. Examples like Africa Singapore and some european countries are clear winners here. 

Do startups need help to grow - Immense. The banks can globally mentor them in several areas where knowledge is nascent. The startups ideas can be brought into mainstram banking by banks and regulators. 
They can get huge help both in terms of investments and funding. 
There can be huge collaboration to grow services that leverage existing banking APIs and add value added services around them. 

The only things that need to change is mindset, the legacy approach and regulations that are just too pro banks.
4/27/20, 21:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Mentor is to pat old age banking egos and agree with things that they wouldn‚Äôt others agree on? Yeah, that sounds fair. The point is banks never walk the talk - And this is not a monetary or fiscal problem, it‚Äôs a philosophical problem.
4/27/20, 21:48 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: True. Thats my ending statement. Mindset (only banks can). Old age approaches (kill startups). And regulations
4/27/20, 21:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Everything else thats visible is camouflage
4/27/20, 21:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hence ^ lol
4/27/20, 21:51 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Oh yes.  Banks ~ collab ~ startups is a joke in itself
4/27/20, 22:01 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Responding late on this thread. I am writing as the founder of a startup, not particularly in the pink of health in this environment. Banks haven't been particuarly good at running accelrators but that has no bearing on what they should be doing today. I think banks have absolutely no responsibility in helping startups at this time, more than any other entity around. I don't think startups need handouts at this time any more than at other times. Some startups will fail, accelerated no doubt by the pandemic, and some will prove to be useful enough to scrape through - but that's the expected behaviour in any case. 
Can banks find new answers in this situation? Yes, but that's to further their own interests and not out of misguided obligations towards startups. So not doing anything out-of-the-ordinary to help startups which are not doing anything particular to make banks' life easier is unnecessary. Can they work with startups better - most certainly, but that's a steady state issue and nothing to do with this pandemic!

*View 32* _Start-up Founder_ 
I am not surprised if Banker says that  start-up is not my responsibility. Here is what they can do.. I can list million such examples. FIAKS community can guide them. 
"Processing March Salary for my team was a challenge since the finance team processes the salaries every month via a physical visit to a bank branch. This month because of the lockdown, the only safe way we were thinking was to enter the account details of each employee online and do individual transfers. It would have taken the finance team two days to process the salaries. My bank should have helped me by  via email. I believe bank compliance team should have allowed them to bypass the regular processes at such times."

Regulators seem more concerned about fraud related to cards hence released the circular. But what about UPI frauds? Why isn‚Äôt regulator issuing a similar circular for UPI?

UPI already has its share of Collect Request frauds wherein the fraudsters misuse the collect request feature of UPI by sending fraudulent collect requests to the person and the person accepts it believing that the payment will be received instead the money gets debited from his account. UPI customer does not see the name and confirms in a hurry. The pop-up should clearly say that your account will be debited.Confirmation buttons are confusing!

A. Can any company in india call itself Neo Bank. I remember RBI having issues with who can call themselves Bank , as it confuses the public  
B. Current model is of Digital partnership for origination- Should. That not be in BOLD on the digital properties. 
C. Banks are building their own Digital properties and they are fully licensed to do so. So if technology is the difference as claimed by Startups then how much differential is required to be valuable.? 
D. Apart from origination fees what are the sources of revenue. ? I understand in card products there is some txn /fx etc..which is all heading to zero. So how is the revenue model working?

*View 2*  _co-Founder_
 
You are right. The word "Bank"is prohibited by RBI unless license is issued. Even BCs are called "Business Correspondents" and not "Banking Correspondents" to a bank to avoid non-bank corporate misusing "bank'" as  a terminology. 

Yes, banks are also building digital properties and can be successful as well. However, higher success would be assured in a Co-working model with FinTech.
4/29/20, 10:30 - +91 90046 19987: Payment banks - A payments bank is like any other regular bank, but operating on a smaller scale and without involving any credit risk. It can carry out most banking 
operations but can‚Äôt advance loans or issue credit cards. It can, however, accept demand deposits (up to Rs 1 lakh), offer remittance services, mobile payments/transactions and other banking services like ATM and debit cards, net banking and third-party fund transfers (more like deposit-taking companies).

Neo-banks are fully digital entities without any physical network. What they offer- accounts credits payments and other such services. They usually don't have licences of their own but rely on bank partners to provide bank licensed services. So these are basically fintech firms that provide digital and mobile-first financial solutions. However, regulatory norms in India restrict such entities that are 100 percent digital.

Sale of stock should be allowed which is definitely normal, but alongside it creates a doubt in the minds of common investors as to why the official is selling the stock when the official has been invested or associated with the organization throughout like for instance, Uday Kotak of Kotak Bank. Also, there is a need to implement a cap as to how much stock can be sold. The regulator needs to think through this to bring a way out.

*View 1*  Leadership team of  large PE/VC 

There are SEBI guidelines for disclosures on sale of shares by Promoters. Equity, by nature of risk for the investor, should not be over-regulated. The RBI wants Promoter holdings to drop over a period of time, which is contrary to the overall need for more capital. If the bank is well run, outside capital will also come in, diluting the promoter holding automatically

*View 2* Founder PE/VC

My basic difference on this is : No person is greater than the Institution. It is perception in our minds. Having said I must say that that all shareholders should have equal and similar rights to sell their shares. There are disclosures both on pledge and sale of shares by these people. A tight compliance of the process is important.

China‚Äôs decision to suspend a tie-up between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges is less a blow for markets than a warning shot to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he readies the UK for Brexit.

According to people familiar with the matter, the Chinese government has temporarily halted the Shanghai-London Stock Connect on political grounds. One person said that Britain‚Äôs stance on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is one of the issues that prompted the move, and that how relations with the UK proceed will determine whether the link is restored.

Lesson to African leaders & rest of the world tooo:
The developments in the last 3.5 years is an indication that the west  will never help anyone anymore.  They made a mistake with China and it will never repeat itself. Our problem now is how can we beat the chinese invasion and build our own industrial capacities? Our hope lay in *AGRICULTURE*, it's the only level playing field left for us to build our capacities on.  This corona moment offers the best opportunity to escape the strangulating grip of these unhelpful partners.I pray we seize it and run with it

*View 1* _Fintech Founder and FIAKS maven_ says 

could this be the first of the steps on China isolating itself from the other stock exchanges and building up its own economy. Since today, theirs is the only economy functioning - US / UK / Europe are shut to a large extent.
4/30/20, 16:12 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community members on my view on the african movement away from China*

He says we  having been working in the area for over 10 years. The chinese built a lot of infra with long term financing agreements and the governments there cannot move out. Quite like the Sri Lankan and the trade corridor through Pakistan.
The only hope for them is in agriculture and food processing - this is totally out of the Chinese hold. Food processing is a big opportunity, farm mecahnisation is also huge.
local manufacturing is also huge - Ethiopia is setting up bus / truck assembly, but then again with chinese companies. 
We from here can move in there with food processing in a big way. we already are large in Ethiopia / Kenya / Rwanda / Uganda with agriculture

The old economic order is scrambling. An emerging new world economic order is currently being negotiated in a disorderly manner, reminiscent of the pre 1st world war era. 

The next 5 years will bring forth an outline of what the new order will be like. *What is certain is India and China will lead it the path finding*. The west will struggle to earn the peace keeping mandate for the world and will use it to negotiate a space. 

The Trumpian bullying will force a fracture of the Internet to a regional structure and the interwoven global financial structure will be less effective. The regional bodies will rewire the financial system with great efforts from China and India.  

The question is to what degree can these two countries carry the developing world along? 

*Are they preparing for the role that will be trusted upon them*, given the propaganda machine of the west?

Will this new relationship be mutually beneficial or it will be a case of winners and the losers?

4/30/20, 18:11 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: China operates as a country, while the rest of the world operates as individual/corporate interests. Even the US, which in many ways uses both carrots and sticks to bludgeon countries to support their economy and industries, is often just a bunch of interests that are not always aligned with the Govt. A recent example: I was on a call with the legal head in the airline industry and they were saying that several of their Chinese vendors had produced Force Majeure certificates issued by the Chinese Govt allowing them to invoke the FM clause in their contracts. No other country seems to be that organized behind its industry at that level of detail. 
When dealing with contracts (in an African context) of sufficiently large size, if it is a Chinese company bidding, then the remaining contenders are essentially bidding against the might of the Govt. They will bring the funding as needed and make sure contracts go to their companies.
Strangely enough, this is no different than what the US or the Europeans used to do in the past, except that right now they are looking inwards, particularly the US. Which leads them to lecture on morality and human rights :-)

4/30/20, 18:29 - Vikas Business Phone: Question 

Can you clarify FM clause? Does it mean single pricing/uniform pricing and same terms ane conditions (no matter which vendor/ supplier companies work with?)
4/30/20, 18:32 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: That's the Force Majeure clause, intended to be invoked when natural calamities, Acts of God and, most recently, pandemics prevent obligations under a contract from being met. This, depending on how the contract is worded, may do away with or at least reduce the liability of one  party to the other.
4/30/20, 18:32 - Vikas Business Phone: Ok ok
4/30/20, 18:33 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Many Chinese companies, during the lockdown there, failed to deliver on their orders and instead of letting each company figure things out, the Govt stepped in and provided a certificate (apparently on demand) that allowed the supplier to potentially escape damages

NPCI has clarified that RBI has permitted contactless card payment for amounts above 2k, with PIN being mandatory. Customer can choose the mode. Further simplification of customer experience. Card need not be exchanged. PIN entry is still a concern. How will it relate to NFC based tokenisation using mobile payment needs to be seen.

*Questions raised are*

*Q1* Who is deciding that customer needs contactless payment without PIN???

FYI  i need PIN even for less than Rs 2000. Its very big money for me.  I need to be asked and taken explicit ok  to make it without pin. 

*Q2* How is it called  contactless payment  if PIN Entry is required to entered ?
5/1/20, 11:27 - +91 90233 89243: Contactless with PIN is called a double tap transaction, but still its contactless.
5/1/20, 11:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Q1 & Q2 not answered
5/1/20, 11:38 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Other than Application like Samsung Pay, Apple Pay or Transit, NFC has no significant value.
5/1/20, 11:49 - Vikas Business Phone: *View 8*

1. Nobody is deciding if customer wants. Customer is given an option for either using contactless or contact transaction. It‚Äôs convenience that‚Äôs abt it. If am standing in a line and every time I need to insert my card for initiating a trxn then it‚Äôs time consuming. I would rather use contactless or QR based payment... 
It‚Äôs always going to be risk even if it‚Äôs for txn less than 2k.... it‚Äôs individual decision to go for it or not. *Customer by default is given a Contactless card these days* and if they don‚Äôt want it then they ve a choice to replace the card.
2. It will still be contactless but additional authentication happening using a PIN. Still the merchant doesn‚Äôt have the card details for any fraud txn to happen


*Question* why by default option is contactless???. Banks please dont decide for me. Give that option to me
5/1/20, 12:00 - +91 90233 89243: I think there was a circular that default contactless should be off?
5/1/20, 12:03 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member is again saying* 

I *don‚Äôt want* default option as *NO PIN*. 

Default option must be *with PIN*

_Isn‚Äôt this something like earlier Payment gateway default option was Store card details which is now changed to asking the customer ‚Äúclick here to store your card so that you need not have to re enter card details‚Äù_

Why banks are deciding that less 2000 to be without PIN for me.
5/1/20, 12:06 - +91 90233 89243: They can always choose to go with a contact txn below 2000 as well.
5/1/20, 12:07 - Vikas Business Phone: Every thing is possible .. give me with PIN as default option
5/1/20, 12:10 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Default cannot be decide based on opinion of 1 person. And it's hard to tell what the majority wants and what's good for them from a distance.
5/1/20, 12:10 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: I prefer having contactless as the default option.
5/1/20, 12:10 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Middle ground could be giving this setting per card on the netbanking portal.
5/1/20, 12:10 - +91 90233 89243: Yeah
5/1/20, 12:11 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: But everyone is pushing for contactless so difficult to see that happening in the short term. This will come only if there is a spike in fraud due to contactless.
5/1/20, 12:30 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS DEBATES on why by default option for less than Rs 2000 to be WITH PIN* 

*View 23*
Default cannot be decide based on opinion of 1 person. And it's hard to tell what the majority wants and what's good for them from a distance. I prefer having contactless as the default option.

*View 24* 

default setting with PIN is decided by banks without proper research on what customer wants? It‚Äôs an incorrect approach followed by payment companies/card issuers  and banks to push digital transaction. This way of pushing digitalisation on to the customer is *incorrect*. Hope RBI comes up with circular that by default option is *WITH PIN*
5/1/20, 12:44 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Why Is TDS On E-commerce Transactions A Concern ?*

This is a smart move to tap tax evasion by sellers.

if the salaried class is deducting TDS. So can or so should e-commerce platforms.  Any concern coming their way shouldn‚Äôt be a major problem for them to address as they are already handling such a huge platform.

They need business that can generate cash or give free cash so that they can survive

5/5/20, 13:02 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts shared an extract of an interesting article on ANTI-AGING DRUGS*

The first wave of a new class of anti-aging drugs have begun human testing. These drugs won‚Äôt let you live longer (yet) but aim to treat specific ailments by slowing or reversing a fundamental process of aging.

The drugs are called senolytics‚Äîthey work by removing certain cells that accumulate as we age. Known as ‚Äúsenescent‚Äù cells, they can create low-level inflammation that suppresses normal mechanisms of cellular repair and creates a toxic environment for neighboring cells.

In June, San Francisco‚Äìbased Unity Biotechnology reported initial results in patients with mild to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Results from a larger clinical trial are expected in the second half of 2020. The company is also developing similar drugs to treat age-related diseases of the eyes and lungs, among other conditions.

Senolytics are now in human tests, along with a number of other promising approaches  targeting the biological processes that lie at the root of aging and various diseases.

A company called Alkahest injects patients with components found in young people‚Äôs blood and says it hopes to halt cognitive and functional decline in patients suffering from mild to moderate Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The company also has drugs for Parkinson‚Äôs and dementia in human testing. 

And in December, researchers at Drexel University College of Medicine even tried to see if a cream including the immune-suppressing drug rapamycin could slow aging   in human skin.

The tests reflect researchers‚Äô expanding efforts to learn if the many diseases associated with getting older‚Äîsuch as heart diseases, arthritis, cancer, and dementia‚Äîcan be hacked to delay their onset.

*Q1* Are banks in your country designed for remote working?  Are they not facing challenges in giving connectivity to vendors to operate remotely. Signing contracts remotely (eg: DocuSign), etc.

*Q2* isn‚Äôt this right time for Regulator or banks to formulate policies around this to face or be prepared for such scenarios in future.

Invite views from the community members

*View 11* Founder 
From Australia perspective , i do not know of any bank here offering esigning as such...it is still paper or fax based.

*Views 8*  CXO 
Most organisations have given laptops / desktops at home but have missed out on security.

Lots of work that was outsourced to Fintech/vendors, employs cheap labour like temporary workers/ interns. 

Huge gap between on paper permanent staff at Fintech and actual temporary staff employed which generally gets easily managed by Fintechs during Audits

Sensitive information like card details , contact numbers address, balances can be easily photographed by temporary staff and may get sold in the market. 

Banks are vulnerable to hacks and data theft as web based access enabled to checker.

Community member shares this video to help thought leaders understand what kind of  support *start-up or Small and Medium Enterprise* are expecting during this crises.


Start-up founder says today we dont need invitation to participate in any competition that gives a hope of  winning USD 50,000 in Sept/Oct. As we may not survive.

*We  need work that can help us generate income to fund our expenses OR we need cash in the bank account. We need money*. 

God know when all these rate cuts, various policy announcements will translate   into actual money for us.

5/7/20, 18:33 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: There's NOTHING government did to help startups.
Most of the 'Startups' have revenue less than 20Lakh. So deffering GST payment doesn't help. 
All the Cofounders needs to pay every bills on time.  If someone opts the EMI deferment, he needs to pay atleast 30-40% more. No small scale or working capital loan for service based companies. 
All Competition, Hackathons also doesn't help much as most of the startups are tied up with own or client's project.
Government should help startups by giving them small or medium projects without any bias. Atleast the highly qualified officers can judge the capability.
5/7/20, 18:58 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: 1. The Govt should stop creating hurdles in businesses managing their costs, by creating restrictions cooked up entirely in their rich imagination and dreams of vote banks
2. To not offer double-edged schemes like the ill-structured 3 month moratorium on EMIs/loans which are more or less useless and cut deep either way or mostly meaningless ones like moving deadlines by a couple of months which probably matter more to the large orgs.
3. Use definitions of business categories which cover every type of business, as the current schemes somehow manage to exclude all organizations which are in any technology related activity. Every scheme somehow seems to render ineligible or be irrelevant to businesses of every person I know of personally (admittedly a narrow range), even though those businesses are stressed and could have used those schemes.

5/8/20, 18:01 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 74*

*The Most-Downloaded Apps in India during 8th and 14th April*


*No.1*
Aarogya Setu (5.5million)

*No.2*
Zoom (4.2 million)

*No.3*
Ludo King (3.8 million)

*Other apps that topped the charts:*

Carrom Pool (2.8 million)
Tiktok (2.6 million)
Google Pay (2.2 million)
UVideo (2.1 million)
Whatsapp (1.8 million)

*Aarogya Setu* app, developed by the Government of India has topped the charts despite several privacy concerns. The App is aimed at augmenting the initiatives of the Government of India, particularly the Department of Health, in proactively reaching out to and informing the users of the app regarding risks, best practices and relevant advisories pertaining to the containment of COVID-19. 

*Zoom's* reach in India grew in millions as more and more number of people started working from home. Webinars and online lectures have also contributed to the leaping growth of Zoom in India in spite of increasing fears of breaches in privacy and security.

Out of boredom, Indians also chose to download entertainment apps like Ludo King, Tiktok and Carrom Pool in large numbers!

5/10/20, 15:27 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: This is the new normal sir. We have to live with this.
5/10/20, 15:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or more easily said when people get back to buying / selling / producing all services and products just like before
5/10/20, 15:27 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Even if vaccine is developed, it's not the ultimate solution. We have to maintain checks for atleast next 5 years.
5/10/20, 15:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What you are saying points of A1
5/10/20, 15:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Vaccine is not the solution but without vaccine middle class / upper middle class / rich have no reason to spend or earn like before
5/10/20, 15:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In which cases there is suppression to economy because of fear real/unreal
5/10/20, 15:29 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: What I am saying is, everything has to be one after another
5/10/20, 15:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes that would too correct but timeline wise, it would take way longer if you hold that view point
5/10/20, 15:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Possibly between 18-24 months
5/10/20, 15:35 - Rediff Parag Chivte VP. IIR: B1
5/10/20, 15:37 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Even if someone gets a vaccine he may catch Covid, but may not show any severe symptoms. 80% of Covid cases are already Asymptomatic. So very few actually needs vaccination. This virus has Ro factor of 2.2, so it will spread more in people living in dense areas, or slum. Basically the lower and lower middle class. They need the vaccine first rather than Upper class or Rich. But it will happen opposite  üòäüòäüòä
5/10/20, 15:37 - +91 90046 19987: My opinion minimum 24 months to come out of it completely. Even if vaccine is invented it would take minimum 12 months to reach globally
5/10/20, 15:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Fair
5/10/20, 15:39 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I have a client in NY, USA. His office is in NJ. He was saying yesterday people now don't care of this. They already started to roam around.
5/10/20, 15:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He will care when his payout decreases
5/10/20, 15:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There are 1st order / 2nd order / 3rd order domino effects which need to be factored in
5/10/20, 15:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Economy is a cycle, a gap of confidence at any point translates to the next and so on
5/10/20, 15:48 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: This has happened already. People are now thinking that if lockdown is continued, impact on their pocket will be more.
5/10/20, 22:10 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: US is showing extreme restlessness to reopen. State sponsored benefits are minimum and not sufficient to keep heads above water though PPP has helped to some extent (notwithstanding the botched up execution). 

The failure of Health is bigger than the failure of Finance and US has this mindset that they can overcome anything except that this time fixing health needs more than just finance.
5/11/20, 04:06 - +1 (916) 837-0472: Very true. In fact India is better positioned than the US when it comes to healthcare despite the lower ratio of doctors to patients due to the fundamentally flawed medical insurance system. In India too, there needs to be a return to grassroots healthcare and government led facilities with strict guard rails for Corporate Hospitals and Insurance providers.

5/12/20, 17:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Digital marketing and current product management in the digital world, esp in the last 5 years or so, have become folks who deliver what‚Äôs told without understanding what‚Äôs needed and why and how to prioritise basis of revenue / users / roi
5/12/20, 17:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As this economic pandemic grows, or the next ones comes whenever it does, folks from these domains will face the axe first.
5/12/20, 17:42 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: It may be opposite too. After this pandemic one thing is sure that all business owners will shift towards digital presence. Doctors, Essential Services, Salons, Foods, Education and even Toilet Cleaning.  To sustain and gain advantage in the digital space, people may hire digital marketers. IMO, Digital Marketing will be much more valuable than offline signage in upcoming years.
5/12/20, 17:45 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: BUT, only boosting FB posts or giving Google Ads will not be any value. How much ROI the company is getting, that will be the deciding factor

Just asking because he doesn‚Äôt talk about the matter at hand - data law, but is dissing businesses.

If the chief architect of the law wants an entire body but not the legal framework he designed, what kind of law was designed in the first place?

Shouldn‚Äôt all the *BANKS, REGULATORS, NPCI* be pushed to buy  *tech platform/ Solutions/ POS machines / ATM Machines / Coin or note counting  machines etc* from Local companies *only* for purchase less than say 10 Cr.

5/13/20, 21:51 - Vikas Business Phone: This is the question
5/13/20, 21:51 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Encouraging local is wonderful. Support to help them reach global standards is great too. However, restrictive practices e.g. no global tenders will hide inefficiencies and incentive to improve quality. Free markets should not be disturbed as much as possible
5/13/20, 21:52 - Vikas Business Phone: Local competition is not stopped
5/13/20, 21:56 - +91 90233 89243: It has a cap of 200 crores. Hence bigger players still stay in the game

5/13/20, 22:02 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Only big players only. Others will be vanished
5/13/20, 22:18 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on VOCAL ON LOCAL make banks buy small value products upto 10cr from Local start-ups only* 

*View 5* 

 Need to encourage local POS manufacturing or coin counting machine. Fake note detection machine etc 

*View 13* CXO e-commerce 

I feel the government has done a good job of expressing views for enabling made in India approach. But it doesn't mean government issue order and makes it compulsory. We are still part of the global economy and rest seller need to put effort in marketing this message and make its product globally competitive to think why Indians are not buying India product...they will find parameters like quality, price, sustainability etc and improving those parameters will only help the business to compete globally. Frankly, the message was to make local products compete globally and not banning/closing foreign products. Now the ball is in Indian manufacturer to let the customer decide if the quality is at par to global and obviously valued over and above the foreign competition.

*View 11* Co-Founder Fintech

There are two parts of the whole thing. One is intent and second is expertise. While sounds good about pushing such comtracts and other things local, how many of service provider or manufacturer in this space can vouch expertise? Without risk reward ratio being positive, core components of banking or transactional network will always be procured from established players.

Doesnt mean that they will be discouraged, but they have to demonstrate a very steep learning amd execution curve to reach there. Otherwise it will stay as jingoism for local players.

5/15/20, 18:01 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 75*

*Top 3 Contributors to WHO Fund*

*No.1*
The United States of Americaüá∫üá∏ (11.96%)

*No.2*
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.41%)

*No.3*
GAVI Alliance (6.49%)

*Contributors ranking 4th - 10th are as follows:*

4. UK üá¨üáß (5.86%)
5. Germanyüá©üá™  (5.51%)
6. European Commission (4.77%)
7. COVID-19 SPRPF (4.58%)
8. UNOCHA (4.25%)
9. JapanüáØüáµ (3.77%)
10. World Bank (3.39%)

It should be noted that these rankings and figures hold true only for Q1-2020.


The *United States of America* is the single-largest contributor to the WHO Fund, with a contribution of 553,008K as of Q1-2020. It is a permanent member of the Security Council of the United ations; and has played a vital role in the functioning of various organs of the UN, right from its conception. However last month, POTUS Donald Trump told his administration to temporarily halt funding to the WHO, the consequences of this instruction remain unclear.


The *Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation*, launched in 2000, is based in Seattle. From poverty to health, to education, their areas of focus offer the opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of life for billions of people. The Foundation builds partnerships that bring together resources, expertise, and vision‚Äîworking with the best organizations around the globe to identify issues, find answers, and drive change.


Created in 2000, *GAVI* is an international organisation - a global Vaccine Alliance, headquartered in Geneva, bringing together public and private sectors with the shared goal of creating equal access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. Gavi now vaccinates almost half of the world‚Äôs children, giving it tremendous power to negotiate vaccines at prices that are affordable for the poorest countries and to remove the commercial risks that previously kept manufacturers from serving them. It is the 3rd largest financial contributor to WHO Funding.

*FIAKS CLARIFICATION* 
We recognise your expertise in the subject and the credibility of the source you've mentioned. It is important that the *Quest listed Top 3 Contributors, not countries*. 

WHO receives funds as Assessed Contributions and Specified Voluntary Contributions. The Assessed Contribution is payable as a member of the organisation, and is determined by population and wealth of the concerned state. If those parameters are considered, U.S.A., China and Japan do lead as contributors.

However, the home page of the source site, under the sub-section 'How are we financed' under 'Financial Flow' logically lists Contributors by their 'Specified Voluntary Contributions' (SVC) as these are independent of any variables, and given solely by the discretion of the contributor.

U .S.A. alone made a SVC of 316,096K, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed 327,999K and the GAVI Alliance contributed 189,220K. Japan made a SVC of 95,106K and China made a contribution of 45,488K (according to the source site). 

We do not dispute the correctness of your claim; however, according to our rudimentary understanding, we considered the contributors by their 'Specified Voluntary Contribution' to WHO for the Quest.

5/16/20, 21:16 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Assessed contribution is on the basis of a country GDP and maybe a few other parameters. So it‚Äôs almost like a mandatory contribution for which the member countries have committed.

Voluntary is upto each country to add on top of assessed contribution and is open to any organization which includes Gates Foundation, Rotary etc. 

My limited understanding so far üôè

5/18/20, 12:06 - Vikas Business Phone: *Remittances return, but from rural to urban*

An early pickup in economic activity and rise in reverse remittances from rural to urban have led to revival in domestic remittances in May after a near total collapse in March and April. 

We have observed reverse remittance trends picking up in the last few weeks. This is largely funds being sent for the sustenance of stranded migrant workers in cities by their households,‚Äù said *Ketan Doshi, CEO, Pay Point*. 

Doshi said there has been a slight revival in transactions in May from the earlier weeks of the lockdown due to opening up of smaller towns and some districts in south. However, he pointed out that the sudden spurt could also be attributed to a ‚Äútechnical correction.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhile the volumes are about 35% of the routine observed in February and March, the spurts can also be due to pent up payments going through due to opening up of payment points,‚Äù said Doshi. ‚ÄúThese could be an intermediate spike and not an actual indicator of revival of migrant economy.‚Äù

5/18/20, 17:03 - Vikas Business Phone: If I have 3 bank account with mobile app supporting UPI 

I can create 3 UPI ids.. Right ?
5/18/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes
5/18/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But knowing how many unique bank accounts are being used
5/18/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Is a good metric to know about health of economy today
5/18/20, 17:04 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: You can create multiple UPI ids even with one bank account
5/18/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because most people end up using one active UPI account
5/18/20, 17:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And the lower middle / lower class will generally end up having only 1 UPI mostly
5/18/20, 17:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The point being UPI has dropped by 20% in transaction volume
5/18/20, 17:05 - Vikas Business Phone: Let me raise this question today
5/18/20, 17:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But my guess is unique users will be down by 30% or more or it could be that the unique user drop is 10% yet the transaction volume drop is 20%

In both cases we learn what is happening and understand things better
5/18/20, 17:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Currently no such mechanism exists

5/18/20, 17:13 - Vikas Business Phone: Aayush please edit it
5/18/20, 17:13 - Vikas Business Phone: Oh ok
5/18/20, 17:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can have multiple UPI but they all lead to same Aadhaar and in some case same Aadhaar + same Pan card
5/18/20, 17:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the government can find out
5/18/20, 17:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However financial folks can‚Äôt find out - This opaqueness has been built in as a feature, not a bug
5/18/20, 17:15 - Vikas Business Phone: Why can't then I have multiple bank account with one bank with different branches
5/18/20, 17:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Within same bank you can‚Äôt have multiple UPI too
5/18/20, 17:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can have it from different banks
5/18/20, 17:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Active UPI (Inactive you can have many)
5/18/20, 17:16 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Thats not correct imo. You can still have multiple from same bank and all can still be active
5/18/20, 17:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Since you don‚Äôt have any definition of primary account and non-primary account, you can‚Äôt have definition or primary UPI vs non-primary UPI.
5/18/20, 17:16 - Vikas Business Phone: He is saying possible
5/18/20, 17:17 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Thats right. You can
5/18/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs see where the actual problem is - Multiple UPI is not a problem
5/18/20, 17:17 - Vikas Business Phone: Ok let me raise
5/18/20, 17:17 - Vikas Business Phone: This question
5/18/20, 17:17 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Ayush what you are saying about 1 bank ~ 1 upi id isnt correct
5/18/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The problem is multiple UPI to unique individual identity
5/18/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I agree, I didn‚Äôt mean that
5/18/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs not even the problem I am after
5/18/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You should have 3000 UPI handles
5/18/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It doesn‚Äôt matter
5/18/20, 17:18 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: On every upi app you can actually create a diff id linked to the samme bank
On the same bank app also you can have multiple upi ids linked to the same account and all will be active
5/18/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What matter is can those 3000 UPI handles be uniquely linked to 1 individual
5/18/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For legal purposes, this is possible
5/18/20, 17:19 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Not individual but 1 unique bank account
5/18/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However it is not possible to report it because no organisation / or central nodal authority on the subject doesn‚Äôt talk about unique bank account
5/18/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Same no?
5/18/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Bank accounts are linked to humans
5/18/20, 17:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the problem isn‚Äôt even with identifying but reporting
5/18/20, 17:20 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Nope. You can have 1 bank account linked to 2 humans :)
5/18/20, 17:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The information is akin to HLR vs VLR in telco (for those from the background)
5/18/20, 17:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Fair but it‚Äôs calculable is my point
5/18/20, 17:21 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Why do you need to calculate UPI ids is the point. You need to calculate how many active bank accounts exist and the trx vol flow
5/18/20, 17:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because the medium is transaction matters as well
5/18/20, 17:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If the medium has reduced, it is a worthy barometer to know about
5/18/20, 17:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Then you count the UPI transactions not UPI ids
5/18/20, 17:22 - +91 90046 19987: Are you saying same account multiple UPI or multiple UPI tagged to multiple accounts in same bank
5/18/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: UU to MAU ratio matters
5/18/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As does TXN to unique MAU
5/18/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think it‚Äôs easier to demonstrate with a live example
5/18/20, 17:23 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Thus UPI txns to bank account mapping

1 bank ac ~ muktiple upi ids
Multiple bank ac - multiple upi ids
5/18/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: One to many
Many to many
@919004619987
5/18/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Both are true
5/18/20, 17:44 - +91 90046 19987: Yes. But per PSP one ID
5/18/20, 17:44 - +91 90046 19987: Per account

5/18/20, 19:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Exit pressure will be huge, this number will probably fall further now
5/18/20, 19:37 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: I have a hypothesis for this decline. If someone has data would be wonderful to know whether it's correct or not.

1. UPI P2P ticket size used to be very similar to domestic money transfer. Some DMT has moved to UPI. With migrant labourers earnings and location getting impacted this might have declined
2. E-comm UPI payments have seen a phenomenal growth. Deliveries being stopped would have impacted the P2M volumes
5/18/20, 19:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Can you attribute a number to those assumptions?

Also more local transactions in Sec A + Sec B definitely on UPI amidst all this lockdown. That would have helped the numbers grow in aggregate.

That‚Äôs why I am trying to know unique active accounts.
5/18/20, 19:42 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: It's just two hypothesis. I don't have the latest numbers so if anyone has will be wonderful to know. P2P ticket size used to be ~3000 which was close to the average DMT ticket size

*View 8* _Fintech Founder_
It‚Äôs not even the problem I am after. You should have 3000 UPI handles.It doesn‚Äôt matter. 
On every upi app you can actually create a diff id linked to the same bank. On the same bank app also you can have multiple upi ids linked to the same account and all will be active. *What matter is can those 3000 UPI handles be uniquely linked to 1 individual*

*View 33* _CXO banker_
Velocity is at the account level.  The bank maintaining the account has to keep the check. 

*View 43* _CXO PSU Banker_
1. Multipule UPI ID with different  banks are at par with bank  accounts. It should be treated like different bank accounts.
2. UPI id is always unique but creation of multiple id is possible if the linked mobile number is different in different accounts. All accounts of a customer in a bank are linked with single customer ID. In case mobile is linked at customer ID level all accouts get linked one mobile as such account with different branches have common ID but @UPI or @Bank name is possible. Money laundering has other checks at each bank level.
Cearting UPI based MERCHANT ATMVPA for cash transaction is the best way to monitor, check missuse,  zero day resolution of grivances and make the servicr available at small and remote places with redution in cash transaction cost. *One Unique UPI ID for customer and common national UPI app for all digital TXN can provide better wayout of the issues.*

(Figures in the parenthesis indicate Brand Strength Index) 

*Brand Finance* published it's annual report on the most valuable and strongest insurance brands this month.  The relative strength of brands is calculated through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance. This is expressed in terms of the *Brand Strength Index (BSI) score*, out of 100 points.

The strongest brand in the market, *Poste Italiane*, successfully leveraged its strong territorial network of 12,000 post offices and highly developed digital services to reach its 35 million clients in Italy. It scored a BSI of 85.5 points, a solid boost of 4.8 points from last year. "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poste has demonstrated its commitment to communities through a series of measures, from the introduction of pension withdrawals in alphabetical order to avoid overcrowded offices, working with the nation‚Äôs law enforcement to help the elderly withdraw their pensions, and assisting with mask distribution. These actions are a clear example of Poste Italiane‚Äôs investment to build its brand in line with its products ‚Äì improving consumers‚Äô perceptions of trust and reliability, and hopefully emerging from the crisis with a greater brand equity than before," states the report.

*Ping An* is a Chinese holding conglomerate whose subsidiaries mainly deal with insurance, banking, and financial services. Currently in the second place, it's BSI fell by 2.4 points this year. It has, however, retained its position as the *most valuable brand* in the insurance sector.

Founded in 2015, *Allianz SE*, is a German multinational financial services company headquartered in Munich. Its core businesses are insurance and asset management. The brand shot up by 14 places in the ranking and gain 4.4 BSI points in a year!  Allianz entities worldwide have mobilized resources and launched initiatives - small, big and everything in between ‚Äì to support communities in this difficult time.

5/28/20, 17:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes that‚Äôs the logic

5/28/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Still you are saying becoming?
5/28/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs been 8 years, seniors by now should accept it
5/28/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not accepting has lead to all this anyway
5/28/20, 17:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Look at US as well
5/28/20, 17:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Communication is a pipe - If you want to add value, you need to add value to the pipe cia consumption products

In a very interesting manner, albeit not very directly, this is what Google gets so very well - For it the sort of pipe is search and mail
5/28/20, 17:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also what Facebook gets when you scroll through it‚Äôs endless stream for free

5/28/20, 17:08 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I think they became a pipe some years ago. Perhaps a decade or so. In fact, even that is under threat with Voice-over-WiFi where even the pipe might belong to someone else üôÇ. I think their biggest value now is as Identity. They are probably the biggest identity providers worldwide.

5/30/20, 15:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Pent up demand
5/30/20, 15:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: + Channel shift due to other channels closing / perceived unsafe
5/30/20, 15:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However overall demand will be significantly down for white goods (including others) going forward
5/30/20, 16:13 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: White goods demand is generally cyclic. And periodic. Didn‚Äôt understand whats logic of it going down
5/30/20, 16:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Demand suppression due to aggregate per capita disposable income going down
5/30/20, 16:41 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Gdp and per capita affects a lot of things and overall spends will go down across the board. A lot of white goods are connected to ‚Äúessentials‚Äù so not sure i agree with ‚Äújust white goods demand coming down‚Äù
5/30/20, 16:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Btw these discussions take me back to bschool :)

5/30/20, 16:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Btw the data is very awkwardly represented -

It‚Äôs Tier 1 but minus Delhi and Mumbai?
It‚Äôs showing base as Feb but not last year or any other month?

Why such exclusions?
5/30/20, 16:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Oh I meant a lot of stuff will but definitely white goods as well
5/30/20, 16:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: True that
5/30/20, 17:52 - Wechat Nilay Arora IiNC: If it‚Äôs truly pent up demand... possibly it should go to twice the earlier monthly levels.
5/30/20, 18:15 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: This is probably due to lack of domestic help as reported in the article, plus dishwashers are more hygienic and therefore may be spurring buying behaviour during the pandemic.

Manufacturers also claim that dishwashers save water compared to hand washing but I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is true.
5/30/20, 18:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Should but hasn‚Äôt because reduced disposable income and income uncertainty

*907*- Qiqihaer from CHINA


Colour Code on map
*BROWN = Hazardous* 
*PURPLE = Very Unhealthy*
*RED = Unhealthy*


(FYI - Good Quality Air means count to be less than 50)
5/30/20, 19:58 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Interesting and sad data...also, considering it‚Äôs all happening with few months to go for the US elections. 

Trump supposed to have an easy win and looks like the virus could end up doing what the Democrats would have failed at
5/30/20, 19:59 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: From both political and economic point of view, it will be advantage for India with Trump at the Oval Office and the Chinese would want him out
5/30/20, 20:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Anybody pro-Chinese won‚Äôt get voted in any large democracy for the next half a decade
5/30/20, 20:01 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: That‚Äôs true...but the voters can turn against Trump and vote for the Democrats who could end up with a soft strategy against the Chinese
5/30/20, 20:01 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: That‚Äôs very accurate
5/30/20, 20:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Trump has a straight win
5/30/20, 20:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In any nationally divisive fight, the right will get more votes
5/30/20, 20:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because it is mostly the swing votes that count in most election and swing will favour nationalism
5/30/20, 20:03 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Consider this...the entire Democrat lobby has spent last 3.5 years propagating that the Russians masterminded Trump victory. 

Conveniently, we are having a deadly virus originate out of China and gets into the US few months before the elections with 100,000 deaths and with over 40 mn job loss (still counting)
5/30/20, 20:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: ^
5/30/20, 20:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The American left is fragmented to its worst ever
5/30/20, 20:05 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: It‚Äôs totally true...but when loss is both at Humanity and job loss at one go; it takes lot of work to tackle it
5/30/20, 20:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It won‚Äôt be able to support any candidate because imperfect candidate no matter who would have won nomination
5/30/20, 20:05 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Joe Biden is definitely a very weak opponent and the swing states are more crucial than ever before
5/30/20, 20:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also Trump is left of centre when it comes to middle America job wise
5/30/20, 20:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And it‚Äôs significantly right to east cost and west coast
5/30/20, 20:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Left has nothing really to play with minus Trump tweets
5/30/20, 20:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Given China‚Äôs stance, more left folks will turn towards right and end up favouring Trump
5/30/20, 20:08 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Trump won the last election propagating the average Joe doesn‚Äôt have a livelihood anymore...

Now both life and livelihood have taken a huge beating. 

Let‚Äôs wait and watch on how the cards are getting played out.

But with Trump at the defensive and his basic nature is always to be ultra-offensive; the campaigns and debates could be a very very interesting affair üòäü§î
5/30/20, 20:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He will still play offensive
5/30/20, 20:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He knows that‚Äôs why people vote for him
5/30/20, 20:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is nothing called defence in the Trumpian world
5/30/20, 20:09 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Yup...that‚Äôs the only game he knows...probably, he would go ALL OUT
5/30/20, 20:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Joe Biden is probably the weakest democratic candidate in last two decades
5/30/20, 20:10 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Yup...the Democrats lost it all when they chose him
5/30/20, 20:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The entire debate is whether Trump is great or not-great, which makes it a personality vote
5/30/20, 20:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And in personality voting Biden won‚Äôt be able to beat Trump
5/30/20, 20:11 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Biden need to stock on lots of Red Bull before the debates üò¨
5/30/20, 20:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: My understanding is that Trump will win both the popular vote and otherwise
5/30/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So that oped pieces can analyse what went wrong etc
5/30/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 2020 America is 2019 India
5/30/20, 20:12 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Hmmm...my best guess is that it could be tough though he still hold the ‚Äòbetter personality to occupy the oval office‚Äô...

Next few months on how he handles both COVID & job loss/economy will play a big X factor
5/30/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He is smart than he looks
5/30/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He ensured that he said a number which sounds devastating
5/30/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In terms of Covid-19
5/30/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Under promising and then will somehow overdeliver
5/30/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He said the 1 Million dead number over and over and over again
5/30/20, 20:15 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: That will go down in History in a very significant way...a running President who gets re-elected after a Mn deaths & 40-50 mn job losses üòä

5/31/20, 06:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Anyone have an idea where I can try to get data/list of retail outlets in India?
Does any association publish such a list? 

Would this data be available based on listing with shops and establishment act?
5/31/20, 06:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No
5/31/20, 06:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Any such data would be inaccurate
5/31/20, 06:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The best such data is available with ITC / HUL / ColPal / Airtel / VodaIdea
5/31/20, 06:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Organised would be available, not unorganised (which is like 95% of all such shops)
5/31/20, 06:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For 60% accuracy in aggregate numbers but not details check Nielsen
5/31/20, 06:38 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: Long time back, ( mid to late ninetys), ORG MARG, viz todays The Nielsen Company used to do something called Census of Retail Outlets. It used to be a phenomenal exercise.. Not sure if they do it now..
5/31/20, 06:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: dont these "unorganised' shops register with state entities as per shop and establishment act?
5/31/20, 06:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nope
5/31/20, 06:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No one gives a flying
5/31/20, 06:39 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: Telcos would at best have a data of approximately 1.7 Million retailers..
5/31/20, 06:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They still do similar stuff yet the data is largely inaccurate
5/31/20, 06:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: haha.
5/31/20, 06:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats probably only 10-15% of the actual numbers?
5/31/20, 06:41 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Technically they are supposed to. But lots of small unorganised shops dont.
5/31/20, 06:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if we are to go by a very rough 1 retail outlet per 1000 population.. thats about 14 million..
5/31/20, 06:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: even in urban areas, ha?
5/31/20, 06:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Can you enumerate a single real benefit for registering?
5/31/20, 06:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: May be they would get relief from pandemic perhaps
5/31/20, 06:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As you know this isn‚Äôt true - Why should such shops register?
5/31/20, 06:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i was just going to say that! üòÇ
5/31/20, 06:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You must have heard the famous lines - Truth is stranger than fiction & here the jokes write themselves.
5/31/20, 06:44 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: That would be a right esrimate... Between 13 to 14 Million..üëç
5/31/20, 06:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: is the industry expecting a larger chunk of sales to move online, post-covid?
5/31/20, 06:48 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: If they are doing it, it should be  broadly accurate for most markets.. It is an exercise which costs a bomb! And if the data is found inaccurate, they wouldn't find buyers..
And believe me, it is very easy to catch if the data is phony or missing..
5/31/20, 06:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: UK was 10% pre-covid..
probably like 75% during covid..
and maybe settle down to 20-25% post-covid..
5/31/20, 06:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i wonder if similar situation would apply in india...
5/31/20, 06:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The buyers don‚Äôt trust it, that‚Äôs how we know
5/31/20, 06:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 20% inaccuracy is agreed upon
5/31/20, 06:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Internally they also agree
5/31/20, 06:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Easiest to find out if we talk to TSM / ASM / RSM
5/31/20, 06:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 20% is acceptable for data from a top consultancy firm?
5/31/20, 06:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can try and beat them
5/31/20, 06:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Same with CIBIL scoring
5/31/20, 06:50 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: Absolutely right.. üëç
5/31/20, 06:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Read about Nielsen‚Äôs TV reporting fiasco
5/31/20, 06:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And that‚Äôs TV with 100% control on the environment
5/31/20, 06:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That should tell you a lot more about how these things are conducted and how to judge them
5/31/20, 06:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: do you guys have a URL for the nielsens report? i can seem to find a lot of related stuff, but nothinng specific to "census of retail outlets"
5/31/20, 06:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This report is not OTC
5/31/20, 06:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You have to fill forms etc and possibly is not even close to being cheap
5/31/20, 06:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ideally.. i would like a category wise break up of retail outlets, per zipcode! wishful thinking? üò¨
5/31/20, 06:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However an aggregate format of this should be available
5/31/20, 06:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What are you exactly looking at? Both GT and MT?
5/31/20, 06:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Like unorganised / semi-organised / organised ?
5/31/20, 06:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yup
5/31/20, 06:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: organised, not so much
5/31/20, 06:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: unorgannised and semi-organised, probabhly

depends what u call semi-organised?
5/31/20, 07:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Do you remember what are the columns for the data per zip code / area?
5/31/20, 09:50 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Unbelievably bold of Citi to take this stance, on such a charged topic: https://blog.citigroup.com/2020/05/i-cant-breathe/
5/31/20, 11:20 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: https://telecomtalk.info/trai-might-invalidate-10digit-mobile-number/274541/
6/1/20, 07:29 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Microsoft likely to invest $2 billion in RIL's Jio Platforms: Report http://dhunt.in/9PRSP?ss=wsp&s=pa
6/1/20, 07:47 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Indeed. A person of color taking this stand publicly and an organization like Citi backing him up publicly is worthy of applause üëè.

I wish many more organizations will grow a spine and create a chorus that MPD and other such biased establishments will find impossible to ignore.

6/4/20, 00:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Is that based on Moratarium for 6 months?
6/4/20, 00:27 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: 3
6/4/20, 00:28 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Check the last field, left side
6/4/20, 00:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. Noticed now
6/4/20, 00:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: That seems fair, tbh.
6/4/20, 00:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: He is only 1 year into his 10 years
6/4/20, 00:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Outstanding amount is probably 95% of the original loan amount.
6/4/20, 00:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Based on 14% interest, 3.5% gets added to that
6/4/20, 00:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, 98.5% of original amount will be his new outstanding principal after moratarium.
6/4/20, 00:32 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Mathematically, it's correct. Don't know policy wise.
6/4/20, 00:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This number is high because his loan is new and interest will be calculated on outstanding principal which is almost as much as original loan amount on this case
6/4/20, 00:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Moratarium is never intended to be a grant. Its only a relief to postpone loan repayment without penalty or affecting credit history!
6/4/20, 00:35 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Yes. Although I am not really sure, after your job is gone or salary is reduced to half, how you can take those extra 8 months burden just to postpone your emi dates by 3 months
6/4/20, 00:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Well.. When economy is doing well & u doing good business or getting huge salaries, do you want govt to take extra taxes from you? Then, why expect the reverse? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6/4/20, 00:36 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: And surprisingly, this are included in the 20Lakh Crore "Package"üòÑüòÑ
6/4/20, 00:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Havnt gone thro that. What does it say about this?
6/4/20, 00:38 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Yes. Economy is doing pretty well. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
6/4/20, 00:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I dont think you understood what I meant by that statement.
6/4/20, 00:40 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Understood. Metaphor
6/4/20, 00:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Am not sure of figures, but if the govt was to waive off interest for this moratarium & give everyone 6 months interest-free loan on all outstanding loans, that itself is probably more than 20 lakh crores?
6/4/20, 00:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not a feasible situation.
6/4/20, 00:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 7% of total outstanding loans in India -> any idea what that figure is?
6/4/20, 00:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: when u google for it, it seems to show nationnal debt. economy is not my strong point, so not sure what term to search for, tbh.
6/4/20, 00:46 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Although I really don't care. But NONE of the Financial Decisions/Packages are actually helping people. I know around 15 people who lost their job or salary reduced to 50% even 30%. Any idea how they can pay the EMIs now??
6/4/20, 00:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: unfortunately, you SHOULD care. thats a risk you have to keep in mind, when you take loans. 

blaming the govt for it, is mostly political propaganda. 

you may lose your job for whatever reason. this time, its covid / lockdown. next time, it could be a global recession. who is to blame for you not being able to pay your EMI?

you cannot be capitalist when convenient to you, and socialist when not. lol
6/4/20, 00:57 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: I used only for making utility payment.
6/4/20, 01:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yes. same. utility and groceries + bit of food deliveries & light online shopping. despite that, was less than 10% of my usual card spending. thats why am surprised card usage is down only 50%.
6/4/20, 01:03 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Although I am not in a mood to start political argument. But,
People usually take loan to fulfill their needs. Actual Capitalists Doesn't really need a loan. Sell of Maruti is much more than BMW. Instead of helping business, giving out loans to select few, charging people more for delayed payments and calling it a package is simply a Joke. If it is a political propaganda, lets keep it that way.
6/4/20, 01:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: am no economist and am definitely not much of a socialist, but I can assure you capitalists use loans and public money more than socialists, in any economy! not many become multi-millionaires by doing business with their own money alone! lol

also, my personal opinion has always been that handing out freebies for political reasons, is the main reason for stunted growth in india.. unfortunately, in india, being a welfare state is not an option, it is a necessity..

and lets not kid ourselves; you are evidently anti-incumbent govt, which is clear from your protests and complaints pointing fingers at the govt, which is veiled political propaganda..
6/4/20, 01:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: from a layman point of view, i feel giving credit (or extending credit) with interest, is better than giving free credit..

freebies dont do good to the economy.. it doesnt encourage toil or entrepreneurship.. unless your idea of a good economy is something along the lines of the pro-communist economy of kerala..
6/4/20, 01:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: kerala govt has institutionalized LAZINESS, on a state-level, in the name of welfare/socialism! üòÇ
6/4/20, 01:23 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I am also very bad at economics and mathematics. But I don't know how a person becomes capitalist by purchasing a wagnor or a 2BHK.

If you are thinking that I am being political by pointing fingers at bad decision of the govt, I think it's a basic job in a democracy. It's not propaganda. But giving out loans in the name of 20Lakh Crore Package is a Propaganda. 

Every one pays direct/indirect taxes. There's no freebie. It's our money thats given back to us. 

I will be very happy if few small/medium entrepreneur can share their story how they got help from govt in this period. 

And Socialism is not everyone's cup of tea, so let's keep it aside.
6/4/20, 01:23 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Enough. Let's not spam this group.

Whatever you say is correct. I am all wrong

6/4/20, 17:19 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Moratorium is a double-edged sword, Aayush.

If banks has to forego the interest then the same banks should be allowed moratorium and not pay interest to the depositors. 

I am definitely not in favour of the current moratorium concept where the customers have to cough up much more for a temporary relief. 

Probably, the only solution I see if  RBI & Govt come together and provide cushion to banks so that the moratorium in its real term makes sense but not sure about the viability of it
6/4/20, 17:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Banks can‚Äôt forgo interest.
6/4/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The modern monetary system is predicated upon interest at the fundamental base of it. Every other instrument derives itself from this single instrument of interest on loans.
6/4/20, 17:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What is more interesting is that no single country has no control on this at all.

6/4/20, 17:30 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Moratorium gives Customers a choice to keep paying like before or delay the cash flows (with a cost attached to it which comes in the future). Why should banks be burdened? If the decision indeed is to not have any interest for this period, 100% of the borrowers will be incentivised to not pay for this period. It's free money and if banks are borrowing at a cost and not making any revenues... I think the system will soon be doomed.

My view is there are measures required other than interest free loans!

6/4/20, 17:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Esp at a time when the cash flow might be a problem
6/4/20, 18:18 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I am wondering if this could have been structured differently, with exactly the same financial impact but significantly higher *perceived* value to the borrower. If the 3 (or 6) months EMI were given in cash to the borrower without stopping the EMIs, then the borrower gets extra money for 2 (or 5) months. It gets added to the principal exactly as it is being done today. It makes almost no difference from a financial structure point of view but could be seen as more useful by borrowers. Doesn't change the poor nature of the choice, just makes it potentially more palatable.

http://bit.ly/3gRourM
6/4/20, 18:32 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: The difference is only in execution. If someone has an EMI of 50,000 Rs then this person saves 3 lakhs if opting for a 6 month moratorium. This gets added to the outstanding etc. If on the other hand the borrower was given 3 lakhs in cash and the EMIs continued, it probably makes for a happier customer as the perceived value of getting that 3 lakhs up front is higher over saving it across 6 months
6/4/20, 18:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Arun is right on one account - More money supply from demand side (therefore perhaps marginally better demand) but that is also the problem, the government will have to bear that money supply.
6/4/20, 18:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In other words this won‚Äôt necessarily lead to higher demand output and will almost necessarily lead to more ratings downgrade for sure along with higher NPA risk for banks.
6/4/20, 18:35 - +91 90233 89243: +1
6/4/20, 18:46 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Correct. Payments are deferred and continue to be borrowers obligation. Interest is not forfeited. 

The Government has stepped in with financial assistance directly to those whose income is affected. Not related to whether they have a loan or not.
6/4/20, 18:50 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: It is hard for any Govt to subsidize interest on loans directly as it becomes partisan to those who have loans vs those who have not taken loans but are facing hardship nevertheless. 

And therefore the criteria for economic assistance needs to be based on income loss and not on the debt burden for an individual.
6/4/20, 18:51 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I am not sure about the last statement. DBT is only for people with lower income class. There's no other Financial assistance to anyone. If you include loan, then yes some MSMEs will get. There's no one in this country who have same cashflow or income before Corona.

6/5/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 78*

The answer to today's quiz is:
*John Shepherd-Barron*

A British national who was *born in Shillong, India*, he is acclaimed to be the *inventor of the first ATM* in 1960, then known simply as a cash dispenser machine.

The story goes that John, who missed his bank's opening hours on the fateful day, was in the bath when he had a 'Eureka moment' and drew inspiration from a chocolate vending machine to build the world's first cash-vending machine. This booth dispensed cash in exchange of coupons, with a maximum withdrawal of 10 Euros! *Barclays* was the first bank to host this machine next to its branch in London. Although there's a chance that the story has been dramatized, it is known that there were several other engineers working in a similar direction. Their main aim was to incorporate the 'self-help' trend in the banking sector and automate the teller's job.

Today, ATMs have come a long way since the initial simple, gullible and varied design to a more sophisticated, secure and a globally uniform mechanism. Today's users access their accounts through a special type of plastic card that is encoded with user information on a magnetic strip. The strip contains an identification code that is transmitted to the bank‚Äôs central computer by modem. The users insert the card into ATMs to access the account and process their account transactions.

6/9/20, 17:16 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: Here‚Äôs an experience with HDFC Bank.

The link to apply for moratorium extension is shared by HDFC Bank on the evening of 5th with a statement that if the EMI for the month of June was deducted before the customer applied for extension of moratorium, the EMI amount will be refunded to the customer‚Äôs account subject to the customer having applied for the extension of moratorium in the same or the earlier month i.e. June. 

However, the Bank takes more than a week to refund. The Bank has enjoyed the float and has, in all probability, made money on the same as well for the entire duration of this delay. 

While the raise in tenure and interest is justified, how is it justified that the bank parks this amount and uses the float, the customer loses the interest on the same and ends up paying more and longer. 

Why should it take so long to process a moratorium request?
6/9/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs a trick to get more float
6/9/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Said the same thing two months ago
6/9/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is why Indian banking is not trusted and won‚Äôt be trusted
6/9/20, 17:17 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I was asked to send my last 6 months A/C statement by a NBFC. Sent. No reply from them till now.
6/9/20, 17:18 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Chaliye tab Neobank kholte hay. üòú
6/9/20, 17:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No point, India deserves to be downgraded by rating agencies on such accord
6/9/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Unless the politics gets bankrupt, banks won‚Äôt be
6/9/20, 17:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You are now paying Banks a fee for their NPAs and hence no rate translation from RBI to Banks to you.
6/9/20, 17:20 - +91 90233 89243: http://www.icsi.org.in/banking
6/9/20, 17:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: A friend applied successfully and the bank didn‚Äôt even send a ID for the ticket
6/9/20, 17:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Imagine
6/9/20, 17:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Btw the link was hilarious and it was only sent on mobile and not email, with a disclaimer about how moratorium is bad - I mean it was hilarious that only 65+ year old people can think about this
6/9/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: (Yes ageism is real, please get over it, otherwise look at telcos)
6/9/20, 17:23 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: May be it was thought and implemented by a 65 year old üòú
6/9/20, 17:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
6/9/20, 17:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: See lol hahaha
6/9/20, 17:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What all this tells me is that NPAs for Banks will skyrocket
6/9/20, 17:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They are so scared, but I don‚Äôt feel bad for them at all
6/9/20, 17:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i dont think these non-payments get classified as NPA, anyway
6/9/20, 17:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nope not that
6/9/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All this float is just cushioning for future NPAs predicted
6/9/20, 17:25 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Well delinquencies may go up anyways in this economic condition
6/9/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes but think about Banks with current NPA levels
6/9/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: + future
6/9/20, 17:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is recipe for contagion
6/9/20, 17:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: seems like a perfect environment to try out MMT
6/9/20, 17:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: MMT = Modern Money Theory
6/9/20, 17:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Aka money is free theory
6/9/20, 17:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That America will do for everyone else
6/9/20, 17:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: well.. it is if you print USD..
6/9/20, 17:26 - +91 90233 89243: :)
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: but, for other countries to, to some extend, may be feasible...
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And China will manipulate its price to balance
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: especially if trade deficity is not substnatial.
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Everyone else will sell to them
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and with lower oil imports and high unemploymennts, its a suitable environmennt
6/9/20, 17:27 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: But likely to have trade deficit
6/9/20, 17:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The more we detach value creation from value the more monetarist we become
6/9/20, 17:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The only thing that governments do today is move the IS/LM curve
6/9/20, 17:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And imagine the world will be in a better place
6/9/20, 17:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6/9/20, 17:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its always been a concept of interest for me -> will govt printing money to create jojbs for unemployed really cause inflation?
6/9/20, 17:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think we will bore people here by talking about this
6/9/20, 17:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i understand if the employed start earning more, but if the new money created is channeled to creating new jjobs, exclusively for unemployed.. will it really affect the others?
6/9/20, 17:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yeah! üòÑ
6/9/20, 17:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But the short answer is if people are unemployed that means they don‚Äôt have value to add to a product or service, therefore ultimately free money is essentially just printing and giving it to them / Aka NREGA^NREGA
6/9/20, 17:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Of course, shifts demand curve so affects supply curve
6/9/20, 17:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: How does this become positive?
If you export, in fact only when you export, that too in dollars.
6/9/20, 17:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You see this is why there is dollar hagemony
6/9/20, 17:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: are you implying, food gets more exxpensive to city dwellers if villagers dont starve? üòù
6/9/20, 17:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sounds much better the way I say it / or ask why are global agro prices so suppressed
6/9/20, 17:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Farmer income will double but I won‚Äôt pay for it theory
6/9/20, 17:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because farmer will come to city to become urban poor from rural poor
6/9/20, 17:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: oh. that reminds me.. another thing this environment is ripe for -> de-urbanization!
6/9/20, 17:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: the reverse of that!
6/9/20, 17:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i mean.. if situation is made better by artificially creating jobs in rural area, they wouldnt need to migrate to cities to make a living?
6/9/20, 17:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Chalo let‚Äôs get back to why HDFC is stealing our float
6/9/20, 17:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
6/9/20, 17:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sure, so pay more for food, or make factories to make products for India or outside.
6/9/20, 17:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: has to be done by govt, by printing new money! coz the way I see it, thats probably the only way new money creation wont cause inflation to the general economy.
6/9/20, 17:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It will cause but that‚Äôs ok
6/9/20, 17:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: anyhow, like you said, lets not spam here. will DM u bit later!
6/9/20, 17:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indian urbanites need to step up their game
6/9/20, 17:39 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: As of now its deflation. So it will be long before we see inflation
6/9/20, 17:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Haan but won realisation nahi hai na
6/9/20, 17:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We like lying with statistics
6/9/20, 17:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also deflation may not translate to consumer economy / B2C and might just stay at B2B + employee level
6/9/20, 17:40 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Q1 of this FY, even the statistics will change. Corona excuse there do some correction atleast
6/9/20, 17:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Consumables cost has gone up btw
6/9/20, 17:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You might have stagflation before deflation
6/9/20, 17:41 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Our inflation is largely WPI based
6/9/20, 17:41 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: *numbers
6/9/20, 17:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Agreed that might need changing, some change has happened, might be rolled back as well to suit statistics as needed
6/9/20, 17:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Then we question how come downgrading
6/9/20, 17:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs have our own agency and rate ourselves
6/9/20, 17:42 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: That is the privilege reserved for few.. very few
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yeah.. exactly why its a good time to experiment with MMT..

if govt prints money to create sufficient agro/infra jobs in rural areas, will it really affect the rest of the economy.. or increase inflation onnly inn the rural areas -> does it mean the divide betweenn rural and urban would reduce then?
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Privilege / delusion / Don‚Äôt know which one
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Had China and Russia together gone for a kill - removal of dollar domination
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Everyone is deluded
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: it will happen, eventually..
6/9/20, 17:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: RealMe sold all its TV in 10 mins flat online while people were doing anti-China rhetoric
6/9/20, 17:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India‚Äôs richest person someday will be some standup comic

6/9/20, 17:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: sold out, ma guessing?
6/9/20, 17:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this is a lame logic, if you ask me.
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Here is the deal - Consumer will always win
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: china is building USD reserves..
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If consumer has money, nothing else matters
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and US jjust prints them
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: like really? what chance does china even have?
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The problem with China is that it‚Äôs still at a per capita level no where near the west
6/9/20, 17:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This aggregate economics looks all good but in reality it will forever be about individual real income
6/9/20, 17:46 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: True. And India is still a fraction of China
6/9/20, 17:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It tomorrow US does Chinese embargo, China goes down on the income ladder by 1/5th every quarter
6/9/20, 17:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: hmmmmm
6/9/20, 17:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All the money that needs paying can be paid by printing
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And borrowing in many formats
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what happens if china dumps USD?
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: like say 2 of the 3 trillion they sitting on?
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: US doesn‚Äôt need your permission to print money, it only needs its own permission
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nothing happens.
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: with a trade surplus, and low oil prices, they dont really need it.. do they?
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: You're ignoring Hong Kong
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That money will get lapped up
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: US if it wants can destroy China in two quarters
6/9/20, 17:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ok. 4 trillion!
6/9/20, 17:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because only consumption drives economics
6/9/20, 17:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If you don‚Äôt have future growing consumption, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your rhetoric is
6/9/20, 17:48 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: That's a hell lot of money to be produced/exchanged
6/9/20, 17:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is the simple basis of all economics we see and have signed on since Bretton Woods
6/9/20, 17:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What % of US economy is that?
6/9/20, 17:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It will buy less missiles for 2 quarters
6/9/20, 17:49 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Going be claims - 25% ??
6/9/20, 17:49 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: *by
6/9/20, 17:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: USs biggest power is the acceptability of its currency. a huge hit could have a cascading effect...
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: US is at 21-22 Trillion
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats the only reason I can think of why china will continue to build USD reserves..
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Chinese attempt seems to be to break the backbone of US. Guess the kill part will take some more time
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What is acceptability of currency?
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and now, with a global versionn of CNY
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and a CBDC
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Belief in what currency will work
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And get accepted worldwide
6/9/20, 17:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they are actually ready to offload USD.. theoratically, atleast!
6/9/20, 17:53 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Anyhow, it's been too long a time for this fiat currency to have been around
6/9/20, 17:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: RMB is a joke vs USD is USD is fighting an active trade war against RMB
6/9/20, 17:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Who in their right mind is going to bet in favour of China when the entire world is against it?
6/9/20, 17:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Either internally or externally
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: China‚Äôs only way out is to say sorry and give loans
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Winner takes it all
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Any other moves and it loses
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not about betting on china. chinas reliance on USD is what am referrinng to.
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Not everyone is happy with the way US interferes in Oil rich nations matters in the name of democracy
6/9/20, 17:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But less people will care further
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and several OPEC countries are movign away from USD
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The rich don‚Äôt care about oil anyway
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because the money has gotten out
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: inndia too, trades oil with UAE in INR now
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Please remember Saudi and UAE will never fight India anymore on any issue for real
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The answer to why is Reliance
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is how economics works
6/9/20, 17:55 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: It's a fraction of what we import. KSA, Iran, Iraq seem to be main suppliers
6/9/20, 17:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Iran will need to be more right wing economics at some point in this decade
6/9/20, 17:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Iraq is in too much turmoil
6/9/20, 17:56 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: KSA didn't cut output to suppress Shale gas (US). They seemed to have sided with Russians on this
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India actually gains from all this
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: At some point more oil rich nations will panic
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Yea. Oil bill is reduced
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because there is a trend on hedging by oil rich countries into new energy resources worldwide via their sovereign funds
6/9/20, 17:57 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: But we are consumption based economy. This inertia (lockdown) will take years to become momentum
6/9/20, 17:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Don‚Äôt think that trend is being not noticed
6/9/20, 17:58 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: *gain momentum
6/9/20, 17:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Frankly I think the oil hagemony is over
6/9/20, 17:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Even if it comes back, it will do so for a couple of years and then go back again
6/9/20, 17:59 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: So gold then ?
6/9/20, 17:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also higher oil price = Higher valuation for other energy sources
6/9/20, 17:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because replacement cost becomes much better
6/9/20, 17:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So in theory, low oil price is how oil economies survive for longer
6/9/20, 18:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not a useful enough commodity
6/9/20, 18:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The money will go into other energy sources (if it goes in that direction)
6/9/20, 18:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs put the focus back again - Why is HDFC stealing our float.
6/9/20, 18:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So many people may be some have some answers
6/9/20, 18:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am sure many people are connected to HDFC here very directly
6/9/20, 18:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am sure many are forum members as well
6/9/20, 18:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs see if the forum is actually of some real use for answers apart from theoretical gyaan from us all
6/9/20, 18:52 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: They've been doing it for ages. It business - increase float, CASA, fee income, cut costs. Lend wisely - have decent NIMs. You can do all of the former and a little slip-ups on lending can bring it to negative territory. It's tough job and hard work. Boond boond se Sagar banta hai. The very fact that they have been consistently good at both micros and macros is worth praising
6/9/20, 18:52 - Vikas Business Phone: Let me raise this question ?
6/9/20, 18:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All of it is very cute, ask them to resolve it with RBI and ministry of finance.
6/9/20, 18:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not with customers
6/9/20, 18:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Please do
6/9/20, 18:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: if they suggest that interest on deposits be cut in equivalent portion, that will not be in customer's interest

6/9/20, 18:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: why should the banking sector take the onus of a sovereign nation ???
6/9/20, 18:55 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: let the government credit whatever it deems necessary
6/9/20, 18:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It should but for it to not, banking will need to grow some

6/9/20, 18:58 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: In a nation as corrupt as ours - that's calling for a doom's day too early.  take the top 10 defaulters and they will be contributing to >80

6/9/20, 19:11 - Vikas Business Phone: <191> *FIAKS community Debates Tonight* _Why should it take so long to process a moratorium request?_

Here‚Äôs an experience with large Pvt sector  Bank that is  shared by the community member.

 _He says_ The link to apply for moratorium extension is shared by this  Bank on the evening of 5th with a statement that if the EMI for the month of June was deducted before the customer applied for extension of moratorium, the EMI amount will be refunded to the customer‚Äôs account subject to the customer having applied for the extension of moratorium in the same or the earlier month i.e. June. 

However, the Bank takes more than a week to refund. The Bank has enjoyed the float and has, in all probability, made money on the same as well for the entire duration of this delay. 

While the raise in tenure and interest is justified, *how is it justified that the bank parks this amount and uses the float, the customer loses the interest on the same and ends up paying more and longer*. 

*Why should it take so long to process a moratorium request?*

*View 32* _CXO MNC banker_
 
A bankers view, to build a moratorium or a pause technology in the short term might have not been done, which means everything is being done manually, the system/ person that processed and approved the request and then forwarded it to whoever handles payments etc might take time if done manually, noone is thinking about the immediate hit that bank p&Ls are taking!!

Let's reverse this question, this person clearly had the funds in his account, and managed for a week, he would hv enjoyed the float right of the money that he technically owes to the bank?? I don't think ppl hav understood the spirit of moratarium. Sometimes it might be nice to appreciate the bankers view too!!

*View 12* _CXO/Founder FINTECH_ 
It‚Äôs a trick to get more float
This is why Indian banking is not trusted and won‚Äôt be trusted. I was asked to send my last 6 months A/C statement by a NBFC. Sent. No reply from them till now. No point, India deserves to be downgraded by rating agencies on such accord. Unless the politics gets bankrupt, banks won‚Äôt be. You are now paying Banks a fee for their NPAs and hence no rate translation from RBI to Banks to you. A friend applied successfully and the bank didn‚Äôt even send a ID for the ticket. Imagine. Btw the link was hilarious and it was only sent on mobile and not email, with a disclaimer about how moratorium is bad - I mean it was hilarious that only 65+ year old people can think about this

*View 37* _CXO FINTECH FOUNDER_ 
In a way, it‚Äôs implied complicity. There is no pressure from regulator to be on right side of spirit. I have seen some lenders even sending mailers to customers who already applied for moratorium 1 to opt in again otherwise they will start deducting. That goes totally against what SC had guided banks and lenders for.

Anyhow it‚Äôs no incentive for customer besides managing cash flow to opt in. This way banks are actually trying to exploit the ones who are most affected (hence need moratorium) rather than supporting.

One counter view is also that banks want customer to pay and not opt in for moratorium so their liquidity and portfolio is maintained. Atleast some of affected customers will opt against going for moratorium once emi is debited.

6/9/20, 20:25 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: I think people forgot that RBI didn't insist on any bank to offer moratorium
6/9/20, 20:30 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: I believe that was the initial stance where RBI in good spirit assumed that the banks would offer the moratorium. I do recollect RBI changing the stance to say that the banks must consider the moratorium automatically opted for by all the borrowers unless the borrowers specifically opt out. I may be wrong though. 

Let me think aloud here. If RBI hadnt made this provision, the banks would have incurred incremental costs in recoveries and their own credit ratings would have taken a hit with increased NPAs. The adverse impact on the listed scrips would have been an added blow. This considered, is the RBI option an olive branch to the banks as well?
6/9/20, 20:35 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: on NPAs, it's a double edged sword.  A person who has not managed to pay EMI/interest for 6 months will tend to start default.  The recoveries in soft bucket(generally seen because of technical issues) is very high compared to 60+ DPDs
6/9/20, 20:36 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: most banks/FIs are reporting 60-70% customers having opted for moratorium
6/9/20, 20:37 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: it's like breeding bad behaviour
6/9/20, 20:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or 60-70% are impacted

6/9/20, 20:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: SBI says only 20%
6/9/20, 20:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: HDFC should be much lower than SBI
6/9/20, 20:44 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: seems similar number - read somewhere before second moratorium
6/9/20, 20:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Axis numbers are similar
6/9/20, 20:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So where is this number coming from?
6/9/20, 20:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In value terms it‚Äôs 10-11%
6/9/20, 20:45 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: the numbers I quoted are for NBFCs (private sector)
6/9/20, 20:46 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: can't say.  heard that a Tata group company too took moratorium
6/9/20, 20:47 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: 4 large NBFCs have mentioned similar numbers - 60-70%
6/9/20, 20:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No this is reported

The silver lining to this COVID episode is that power and connectivity have mostly survived, so far. (Thank God for all those who are working for this behind the scenes) So, unless stopped by law/ security, e-commerce continues to provide great convenience. But, when all else fails, the humble cash in the wallet and the old store next door only will stand a chance. We don‚Äôt yet have the level of resilience, redundancy, and reliability in electricity, network, and logistics that would make centralized tech-heavy solutions dependable enough in times like these.

- Wallet to Wallet 
- UPI
- net banking 
- Mobile Banking etc 
- Payment gateway 
- QR Based 
- Credit Cards 
- Debit Cards 
- merchant payments 
- AEPS etc 

Reports should talk of the aggregation of all and not just one pay mode ..  isn‚Äôt it? 

I find it very strange to see the reports that pick up selectively the payment method to showcase that a particular organisation is going well..

When results of an exam are announced we says I got 70% marks. Admission to 11th std are decided basis overall marks. 

We don‚Äôt get admission by saying I got 85% English , 78% in Hindi , 95% in maths ... 
isn‚Äôt it ?

6/10/20, 15:34 - AZB Prabhanjan Dhotre NnR: Everything these days is about consumer experience... the digital payments shud be graded as per the experiences... jst my opinion... cards swiped... cards used online... wallets / QR / UPI... three basic buckets... eg: I somehow find GPay a lot more cumbersome than a Paytm or BHIM interface and therefore use it a lot lesser than the other two

6/10/20, 18:52 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Hi. I just read the chat. Para 3.6 of the Guidelines on regulation of PA& PG, provide that marketplaces providing PA services will have to segregate the PA and marketplace activities, and to continue PA services, they will have to apply for license. Once segregated, the PA Guidelines will not be directly applicable on marketplace.
6/10/20, 18:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For the uninitiated, what‚Äôs PA services?
6/10/20, 19:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fair enough. Do indian PSPs like Razorpay provide API for segregation like say, stripe connect?
6/10/20, 19:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Simple explanation; any entity that accepts payments on behalf of someone else.
6/10/20, 19:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, this means this would apply to uber / swiggy / dunzo, right?
6/10/20, 19:10 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Yeah.
6/10/20, 19:11 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Most probably it will. But again, we will have to wait for full clarity
6/10/20, 19:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: A marketplace collects payments from buyer, on behalf of seller. So, technically, its a marketplace (acting as wallet of sorts for the sellers). Thats why PA rules apply to them. PA usually holds payment on behalf of seller (vendor/merchant) only, while a wallet holds of both seller & buyer (retail customer).

6/10/20, 19:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Common license for wallet, or marketplace.

PA is PI in europe, which holds only merchant funds & not customer funds.
6/10/20, 19:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: PSPs like razorpay / instamojo should start publishing a blog with regulations & recommendations. It would be so helpful for their merchants!

6/10/20, 19:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In US / EU, yes. I was referring to Indian scenario.
6/10/20, 19:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indian courts will follow, in fact makes even more sense
6/10/20, 20:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. It does, but licensing cost & terms in India are prohibitory!
6/10/20, 20:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 15cr / 25cr paid up capital or net worth for PAs?
6/10/20, 20:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And no ‚Äúsmall‚Äù option for startuos.
6/10/20, 20:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its ‚Ç¨125k (‚Çπ1.1cr) for pan-europe PI license or ‚Ç¨350k (‚Çπ3cr) for full EMI (wallet) license. 

And for startups, there is a small PI or small EMI option with restriction that they do less than ‚Ç¨5m/month transaction volume!
6/10/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Only for Fintech a
6/10/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because that area is being protected for banks and contagion issues
6/10/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For ecommerce the number doesn‚Äôt exist
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If PA rule applies to marketplaces, same paid up capital requirement to apply to them?
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nope
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For Ecomm these rules don‚Äôt apply
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because there no licenses that need application
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Marketplace is different from ‚ÄúEcom‚Äù
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It applies only if wallets exist
6/10/20, 20:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not transactions
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And only if wallets are of certain nature
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No no.
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I want to sell T-shirts on Amazon
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For a brand called Fiaks
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Do I need 25 Cr paid up capital? No
6/10/20, 20:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: A marketplace is actually like razorpay or instamoji. They accept funds on behalf of merchant.
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: A wallet is paytm. They accept & hold funds on behalf of end user.
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So let‚Äôs say I am selling the same T-shirt via Razorpay
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I still don‚Äôt need 25 Cr paid up capital
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Razorpay needs 25cr paid up capital
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not you
6/10/20, 20:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes they do
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: ^
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It doesnt apply to you. I am referring to the marketplace
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For the market place, yes
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No. Marketplace is not ‚Äúfintech‚Äù
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Thats what am referring to, from the beginning
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Qualify it and you will realise why I say this
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All market places are deemed Fintech in India
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Obviously, to sell online, u dont need
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Globally.
6/10/20, 20:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So that‚Äôs why paid up capital
6/10/20, 20:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Since when in India?
6/10/20, 20:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think this ruling is at least 3 years old
6/10/20, 20:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, in europe u have options like stripe connect / lemonway / mangopay which are designed specifically for marketplaces to do business without touching vendor funds.
6/10/20, 20:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Really? So, are all marketplaces really compliant?
6/10/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Will happen in India
6/10/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Needs better risk management systems
6/10/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes / How many market places exist in total?
6/10/20, 20:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
6/10/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: My understanding here is still cloudy / My understanding says the paid up capital is for wallet or wallet like services where money / INR can be kept and transferred I.E. 2 way wallets. If all wallets or all market places need this is something that I haven‚Äôt delved deep enough.
6/10/20, 20:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 100s? Maybe 1000s?
6/10/20, 20:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Wallet & PA are different
6/10/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No no I doubt that. Not more than 100 the kind of market places you are talking about.
6/10/20, 20:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Paytm is wallet.
Instamojo is PA.
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes less than 100
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Scales are less than 50
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Wallet is typically entity that holds end user funds.
PA holds only merchant/vendor funds.
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Worthwhile should be less than 25
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No way. You talking the well known ones. There are so many small ones.
6/10/20, 20:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What if all users are users without distinction?
6/10/20, 20:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Example?
6/10/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I don‚Äôt think small ones exist - The architecture makes it tough to exist, which is the point.
6/10/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Merchant is a user
User is a user
Everything is P2P
6/10/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If something holds funds = Paid up capital
6/10/20, 20:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Small marketplaces will need to use a payment gateway that supports this model üëÜüèº

Here, vendor / affiliate gets settled directly, and marketplace only gets his share.
6/10/20, 20:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No. Why will instamojo hold user funds?
6/10/20, 20:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Then, they become wallet - like paytm!
6/10/20, 20:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No. The reason for this is b2b vs b2c.

Risk profile is higher for b2c financial transactions. And affects end users.
6/10/20, 20:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Thats why stricter compliance for wallets & lesser for PA.
6/10/20, 20:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Atleast, thats the typical model. I am rather lost with Indian model.
6/10/20, 20:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: PA is typically a b2b wallet.
6/10/20, 20:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because essentially it‚Äôs a derisking mechanism, sort of an insurance
6/10/20, 20:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What is paid up capital for wallets now?
6/10/20, 20:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Insurance + barrier to entry + lobby
6/10/20, 20:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
How much is Paid up capital tho?
6/10/20, 20:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Check RBI ruling
6/10/20, 20:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: / Play Money / Poker Starting Hand / Table Stakes

6/10/20, 21:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they do not aggregate funds.
6/10/20, 21:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: a marketplace, for eg, does that with merchants.. they accept funds from customer, for several merchants...
6/10/20, 21:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: google pay is tech platform provider..

6/10/20, 21:45 - +91 90233 89243: But it accepts payment, isnt it?
6/10/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 30% of FB market cap growth in this decade will probably come from india.
6/10/20, 21:45 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: True, and pull his partner along too
6/10/20, 21:45 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Value or volume?
6/10/20, 21:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: no. google pay does not touch your money ever.
6/10/20, 21:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: google pay is not a wallet.
6/10/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs just talk about licensing requirements and who paid what? So much easier for the discussion to have an outcome.

6/10/20, 21:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if its pass thru, they would qualify as PA..
6/10/20, 21:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: atleast thats my understannding..
6/10/20, 21:48 - +91 90233 89243: Oh ok
6/10/20, 21:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: like instamojo, as eg.
6/10/20, 21:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: funds go from bank to instamojo, and then to merchant
6/10/20, 21:49 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Like BHIM was a layer (call it UI if you like)over UPI, UPI was a layer over IMPS, G Pay is a layer over UPI
6/10/20, 21:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yeah
6/10/20, 21:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ok. so, since i been comparinng india-eu scenario..

situation in EU with this sort of service is difference.. a tech platform that cann pull data or do trannsactions from a customers bank account also required a EMI license.. but, activities are different from normal EMI..
6/10/20, 21:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b0000042fMZyAAM

this is an example of a company that does something similar to what UPI is

8. Account information services

to compare a normal wallet license to that....

a) Services enabling cash placement on a payment account
b) Services enabling cash withdrawals from a payment account
c) Execution of payment transactions (not covered by a credit line)
d) Execution of payment transactions (covered by a credit line)
e) Issuing payment instruments or acquiring payment transactions
f) Money remittance
g) Execution of payment transactions via telecoms, IT system or network operator
h) Issuing Electronic Money

EU-28 has a combined GDP of $18T. to get a full wallet license covering the whole region requires 350k (3cr) paid up capital.. india is barely 3T and required 5 times that!

6/10/20, 22:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 1 thing am still unclear.
6/10/20, 22:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: are wallets and PAs the same in india?
6/10/20, 22:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and for wallets, it was 25.. 
and now, PAs reduced to 15, is that referring to wallets? or?
6/10/20, 22:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 0

6/10/20, 22:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: with APIs that connect to a real bank.
6/10/20, 22:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: startups should file a case against RBI for being predatory towards innovation
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: either reduce PA/wallet paid up capital, or have a "small wallet" license for startups, with a restrictionn on permitted transaction turnover..
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: These APIs are to Tech (so called) companies what Vendors/OEMs are for manufacturing. Just that they are plug and play - much quicker
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Go back to history why it was done
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: was it?
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what do you mean?
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: There are around 5k banks in US
6/10/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why the price barrier was put up
6/10/20, 22:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: there is no country in the world where its so prohibitively expensive to start a wallet or bank
6/10/20, 22:14 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Regulated by the Federal Reserve

6/10/20, 22:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: actually.. even with 34, there is a major bust because of mismanagement every alternate year! RBI not doinng much of a good job, ha? üòè

6/10/20, 22:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: @919738199828 - the highlights! üëÜüèº
6/10/20, 22:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So it is rose by any other name
6/10/20, 22:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Cost of being part of this group is 25 Cr
6/10/20, 22:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Simple
6/10/20, 22:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 1.1.1. PAs are entities that facilitate e-commerce sites and merchants to accept various payment instruments from the customers for completion of their payment obligations without the need for merchants to create a separate payment integration system of their own. PAs facilitate merchants to connect with acquirers. In the process, they receive payments from customers, pool and transfer them on to the merchants after a time period.


4.1. PAs existing as on the date of this circular shall achieve a net-worth of ‚Çπ15 crore by March 31, 2021 and a net-worth of ‚Çπ25 crore by the end of third financial year, i.e., on or before March 31, 2023. The net-worth of ‚Çπ25 crore shall be maintained at all times thereafter.
6/10/20, 22:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 1.1.2. PGs are entities that provide technology infrastructure to route and facilitate processing of an online payment transaction without any involvement in handling of funds.


3.7. PGs shall be considered as ‚Äòtechnology providers‚Äô or ‚Äòoutsourcing partners‚Äô of banks or non-banks, as the case may be. In case of a bank PG, the guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India, Department of Regulation (DoR) vide circular No.DBOD.NO.BP.40/21.04.158/2006-07 dated November 3, 2006 on ‚ÄúManaging Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by banks‚Äù and other follow up circular(s) shall also be applicable.
6/10/20, 22:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ

I got this PA / PG requirement from here - 
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0

let me try to find similar requirements for wallets.
6/10/20, 22:30 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: CA can issue a networth statement. Let's say - your company owns a Vintage car
6/10/20, 22:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Cute
6/10/20, 22:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: also..

3.6. E-commerce marketplaces providing PA services shall not continue this activity beyond the deadline prescribed at clause 3.4 above. If they desire to pursue this activity, it shall be separated from the marketplace business and they shall apply for authorisation on or before June 30, 2021.
6/10/20, 22:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Rose by any other name
6/10/20, 22:30 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: In case of NBFC/banks, it's NOF - net owned funds. And no preference shares
6/10/20, 22:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 25 Cr needed
6/10/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: actually.. he has a point..

if i find an investor to invest 1 lakh for 0.01% of my company, that means my company is worth 100 crores! üòÇ
6/10/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: it doesnt say paid up capital, and "own funds" requirement, like wallet license
6/10/20, 22:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Beautiful
6/10/20, 22:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: "Net-worth will consist of paid-up equity capital, preference shares that are compulsorily convertible to equity, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital reserves, book value of intangible assets and deferred revenue expenditure, if any."
6/10/20, 22:33 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Now you need to take valuation report from SEBI registered Cat 1 Mercantile Investment banker. Done using DCF
6/10/20, 22:34 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Last I checked they charge about Rs.1.5 lakhs (valuation using discounted cash flows)
6/10/20, 22:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: do these startup fundings comply by that?
6/10/20, 22:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and whats the status of that startup tax drama?
6/10/20, 22:35 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: The new ones - Yes. Guess it's over an year now
6/10/20, 22:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, u cant raise funds before u have revenue?
6/10/20, 22:36 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: If you are registered with DIPP as a start-ups, then no Angel tax. Else, tax officer can freeze all your bank accounts
6/10/20, 22:37 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: You just need THE valuation report
6/10/20, 22:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i am working on a project in india, and everytime i talk to someone about the plight of startups in inndia, i feel like i shoud shut it down and put my money in a FD üòÇ
6/10/20, 22:38 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Good decision üòä
6/10/20, 22:38 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Without the jugad factor, things are very tough here
6/10/20, 22:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: unfortunately, thats the problem in india..

regulations encourage hoarding.. money gets hoarded and not cycled inn the economy..
6/10/20, 22:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: same with freebies to citizens.. instead of giving freebies to citizenns directly.. it shud go to companies that generate jobs.. so they can pay people for working..
6/10/20, 22:39 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Most of the hoarded money was in pumped up Real Estate which they are trying to wriggle out
6/10/20, 22:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not evenn illegal hoarding.. i mean, even taxed money.. people prefer to put in banks, safe.. coz doing business is so tough and is like a hurdle race..

interesting read for you!
6/10/20, 22:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: "Discussion Paper on Guidelines for Payment Gateways and Payment Aggregators"
6/10/20, 22:47 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Payment aggregation services. Aggregation services provided today payment intermediaries like PayU, citrus, razorpay, bill desk
6/10/20, 22:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i think razorpay will probably qualify as a PG
6/10/20, 22:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: am not entirely sure of their model tho
6/10/20, 22:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: as razorpay merchant, i think u sign a tri-party agreement with the bank too
6/10/20, 22:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and bank settles direct to merchant
6/10/20, 22:48 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Sorry, didn't get that. Could you please explain?
6/10/20, 22:48 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: For aggregators handling funds
6/10/20, 22:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: handling of 3rd party funds is the critera deciding if you are an aggregator.. right?
6/10/20, 22:50 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: For the straight guys it is. Some guys just issue an SBLC from another country against a PO, and it will be discounted against a collateral (multiples of collateral value) and bank keeps threatening you of taking over the property. The judicial system is apparently humane enuf to give you good amount of time to settle at the fraction of initial loan amount !
6/10/20, 22:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
6/10/20, 22:52 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Yes. Greater clarity is required. May be RBI will give clarity on the FAQs they plan to issue
6/10/20, 22:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ü§Ø
6/10/20, 22:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Haha
6/10/20, 22:54 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: I had to search the emoji
6/10/20, 22:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i am launching a hyperlocal marketplace.. to explain in a simple way.. it is a cross between shopify & amazon, but for offline stores..
6/10/20, 22:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, if this PA thing applies to marketplaces, i would need a PG who works in this model, to avoid getting labelled as a PA.. üëÜüèº
6/10/20, 22:56 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Nope, unless they wish to segregate the PA services and apply for license
6/10/20, 22:57 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: https://www.ccavenue.com/alliances.jsp?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3834sOL36QIVVSQrCh02igsuEAAYASAEEgJZoPD_BwE
6/10/20, 22:57 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Will it help ?
6/10/20, 22:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not really. these all seem to be shopify kind of projects.
6/10/20, 23:00 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: In Indian parlance, marketplace is like flipkart while razorpay is a payment intermediary/ aggregator
6/10/20, 23:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, this is the part I dont get.. 
marketplace collects payments on behalf of sellers.. so, thats payment aggregation, right?
6/10/20, 23:04 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Small ones exist now, but it's only a matter of time
6/10/20, 23:09 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Networth of 15 cr for wallets and 25 cr for PAs
6/10/20, 23:10 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Yes true true
6/10/20, 23:11 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: And people like me, decide to answer hours late. Oopsie
6/10/20, 23:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üí∏
6/10/20, 23:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: back to my simple question, if i am a marketplace for offline stores, am i a PA?
6/10/20, 23:14 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: No. Why do you say? Wallet is meant to retain funds, while payment aggregation simply means to process payments and settle. Again, why would you say same, am I missing some point???
6/10/20, 23:15 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Really, all merchants? Do banks directly settle to all merchants?
6/10/20, 23:17 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Nice emoji indeed
6/10/20, 23:19 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Yes you are correct and that's the clarity required from the RBI

6/10/20, 23:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i wonder how many startup founders are loosing sleep over this! lol
6/10/20, 23:23 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Why don't you choose what suits you üòâüòÉ
6/10/20, 23:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, why does entity who holds fund need lesser paid up capital, than entity who is not holding funds? üòÇ
6/10/20, 23:25 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: If Ola founders had thought about taking license for every car, they would have never started
6/10/20, 23:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what! whats this now? what kind of license does every car need?
6/10/20, 23:27 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Now, all state governments have come up with separate license for Ola/Uber
6/10/20, 23:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what do you mean by "for every car"?
6/10/20, 23:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ola did a smart play in london. they launched inn london, knowing uber was at risk of losing their license. and now, nnearly 10,000 uber drivers have moved to ola..
6/10/20, 23:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not sure if customers are moving tho! lol
6/10/20, 23:29 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Each taxi needs some certificate from RTO. Something related to Yellow board. Will share info
6/10/20, 23:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ah fair enough. thats driver/car owner responsibility.

6/10/20, 23:32 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: 'Commercial license'
6/10/20, 23:34 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Missed this one.... Is the marketplace online?
6/10/20, 23:35 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Fair point. but don't PAs process much more volumes of transactions and funds
6/10/20, 23:36 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: It is very simple for powerful people in the system to manipulate and come out with stricter norms , so startup or small companies can not compete. It takes few bureaucrats to design the customised policy.
If you actually see now a days, there are virtual banks systems are available who don‚Äôt have any physical presence but still can operate as banks. But it is a dream in India.
6/10/20, 23:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not fully. doing a small pilot now. delayed few months coz of corona situation.
6/10/20, 23:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: we are inntegrated with instamojo, now.. but problem is this marketplace/pa drama. outcome of that will determine our business model inn future..
6/10/20, 23:39 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Oops.... Good luck
6/10/20, 23:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: does payU provide a stripe connect kind of API, which facilitates direct settlement to vendors/sellers?
6/10/20, 23:40 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Yes. PayU offers direct settlement to sellers.
6/10/20, 23:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: does it support a hold / deposit, by from vendor settlement?
6/10/20, 23:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All this sounds like SLR for business btw

Looking at many banks and private institutions‚Äô failure or drove to moratorium shows the lack of proper audit and transparency by the authorities. Bank failure remains a major threat to consistent economic growth that leads to development. The impact caused by economic contraction prevalent during this phase originated due to several shocks resulting in liquidity preference increase among depositors who preferred holding more currency to demand deposits and other liabilities. While Government & RBI may not bail out all banks (where frauds happened), and it should not do as well, it also cannot leave those affected customers of such banks in a state, where they potentially lose their hard-earned money (that too after paying taxes on received interest as well), creating a situation, that makes them lose confidence in bank deposits. Can bank customers not expect that minimal responsibility from financial institutions (whose major expertise is loan underwriting, in addition to management of transaction lifecycle & payments)

6/11/20, 21:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They were loosing investor money 30:1 (360cr burnt to reach 12cr revenue) in b2b. And now, moved to b2c? üòÇ
6/11/20, 21:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They paid out 100cr in bonuses to founding team from investor money. After making 12cr revenue and 800cr loss.

Only in India. üòè
6/11/20, 21:28 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Why do you say only in India?
6/11/20, 21:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: India & wework.
6/11/20, 21:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
6/11/20, 21:29 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Lots of others - magic leap, juicero, theranos, clinkle, etc
6/11/20, 21:30 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: In fact you can even count Tesla although that company is truly a very happy exception üôÇ
6/11/20, 21:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Tesla? How on earth?
6/11/20, 21:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: He bet everything he had on it
6/11/20, 21:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The only in India statement is only true for: Here we do everything not one thing.

You either become a multi-category conglomerate or die a product company.

However his truth is not understood / not appreciated / not accepted.
6/11/20, 21:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Musk is eccentric, but I dont agree that he will ever siphon off company/investor funds
6/11/20, 21:34 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Tesla bought solarcity started by Musk cousins and saved them from future bankruptcy.
6/11/20, 21:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Uhh not sure if it was a happy thing though / if I am not wrong the solarcity founders weren‚Äôt very happy about what happens / aren‚Äôt happy today as well
6/11/20, 21:35 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Yeah. That's case in India, it's necessary to put out a buffet even if customers can only eat a small amount
6/11/20, 21:35 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: These are in a different league - borderline delusional (or fraudulent, if you are feeling less charitable). Magic Leap had something interesting at one point but the rest had zilch
6/11/20, 21:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Theres controversial decisions &
Then, theres siphoning! üòè
6/11/20, 21:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Exactly but how many agree on this for real?
6/11/20, 21:36 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Agreed. They were worse üòÇ
6/11/20, 21:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Clinkle wasn‚Äôt hyperfunded, was it?
Juicero was just stupid.
Theranos was a scam.
6/11/20, 21:37 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Smart folks realise it over time or get sidelined.
6/11/20, 21:37 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: It was but low. I think 30 odd.
6/11/20, 21:37 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Yup Udaan buy comparison is a truly genuine initiative.
6/11/20, 21:38 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Founders are most probably heavily diluted already and wouldn't see huge upside at high valuation.
6/11/20, 21:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Agreed
6/11/20, 21:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is nuanced and unsaid.
6/11/20, 21:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Udaan, funding wise, is doing what Swiggy did to Zomato.
6/11/20, 21:39 - Vikas Business Phone: Omg!! It looks like such  companies are used to distribute monies for other purposes.. 

100 cr bonus 800 cr loss 12 cr revenue
6/11/20, 21:39 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Also if investors don't have a problem with it then I think founders are right to do so. 
This onus to keep founders in check is on the board.
6/11/20, 21:40 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Premature dilution causes problems which required such fixes, I imagine
6/11/20, 21:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But who gets to fix it? The board or who the board is passed onto.
6/11/20, 21:41 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: Even if investors do not issue, it should not be allowed. Since even investors may have received funding similar. It can not be precedent for doing wrong and siphoning .
6/11/20, 21:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Hardly a comparison.

B2B does not rely on familiarity like swiggy or uber or amazon.

If u offer discounts to get customers, u will lose them as soon as u increase price. They dont care for convenience alone.
6/11/20, 21:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So someone <the greater fool, lack of a better word>, must fix it, but as long as there is a belief that exists someone, all‚Äôs well
6/11/20, 21:42 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Theranos was definitely a scam. Big time
6/11/20, 21:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You see that‚Äôs the point, at scale, there is no B2C or B2B in India at such scale
6/11/20, 21:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Investors keep quiet to avoid embarassing themselves, I feel

How can anyone accept being conned without making a fool of themselves? Lol
6/11/20, 21:42 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: üòÇ
6/11/20, 21:42 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Isn't that the game though at the poker table?
6/11/20, 21:42 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: I think even Dunzo has similar numbers
6/11/20, 21:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Dunzo has buyers ready and sellers who have no choice
6/11/20, 21:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs Google‚Äôs intro into transaction business.
6/11/20, 21:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What I meant is. Udaan was b2b. They used funds to get businesses on board. Unlike a customer who continues using uber / Swiggy bevause he got familiar, a business will not contonue to use a b2b platform if its no more as attractive financially.
6/11/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Udaan never owned the supply
6/11/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Udaan just used the supplier and gave him longer credit period
6/11/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs it
6/11/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They didn‚Äôt even move the price much.
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They were discounting some categories
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What they did / are doing / was monopolise the buyer side platform
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Using investor fund
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Credit period is discount as well
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I understand making a loss
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: But 12 cr rev? 800cr loss?
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I see no reason why Flipkart shouldn‚Äôt go into B2B
6/11/20, 21:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Like HOW ON EARTH?
6/11/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Apart from Walmart saying no
6/11/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: / or buying Udaan
6/11/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In the right time, of course, the greater fool must earn from somewhere
6/11/20, 21:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Moving to b2c seems like a gasp for air!
6/11/20, 21:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India is a very large market for the categories that Udaan sells

6/11/20, 21:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is a grasp for pockets
6/11/20, 21:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Some of those pockets have air, some coins, some cash
6/11/20, 21:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The breathlessness is a dry powder deployment problem of VCs which they will manage
6/11/20, 21:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: When we spoke to someone there last year, they claimed 500cr+ monthly turnover
6/11/20, 21:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Now, with 12cr rev figure. The numbers dont add up.
6/11/20, 21:56 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: GMV perhaps
6/11/20, 21:56 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: They may have given expected revenue üòÇ
6/11/20, 21:57 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Must be the GMV numbers üòÉ
6/11/20, 21:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. GMV. So, they operating on 0.5%?
6/11/20, 21:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: He used term ‚Äúturnover‚Äù, but I figured it was GMV.. point being, even if GMV, 1cr rev for 500cr GMV doesnt add up
6/11/20, 21:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 0.2% sorry
6/11/20, 22:00 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: I have no idea. But B2B platforms can't offord to be much more commission than that
6/11/20, 22:02 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: 0.5% might be gross margins
6/11/20, 22:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Am I missing something here? ü§î

Even pure payment companies who usually have the thinnest margins among b2b businesses, do better than that! Here, they have logistics, and what not!
6/11/20, 22:02 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Then you have all expenses
6/11/20, 22:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 0.2% gross. 1cr rev of 500cr gmv
6/11/20, 22:03 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: It seems way too thin
6/11/20, 22:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Exactly.
6/11/20, 22:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Welcome to India
6/11/20, 22:06 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Atleast it's not -0.2%
6/11/20, 22:06 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Growth phase
6/11/20, 22:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: How can rev be negative?! ü§î
6/11/20, 22:10 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: üòÉ
6/11/20, 22:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Give money to buy / or very high credit period
6/11/20, 22:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Still wont be -ve rev..
They will show the payout as expenses, and book rev on the sale
6/11/20, 22:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let us not challenge people
6/11/20, 22:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
6/11/20, 22:12 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: It's like giving ideas
6/11/20, 22:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Rev can be -ve only when sales booked earlier were reversed
6/11/20, 22:12 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: But the biggest idea of the decade was 'GMV'
6/11/20, 22:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Refunds are considered -ve revenue
6/11/20, 22:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If u have more refunds of
Old sales in a month, than new sales that month, rev is -ve
6/11/20, 22:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Evidently, udaan investors know something we dont. üòÖ
6/11/20, 22:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Do you know why IB makes money?
Not because they know how to sell better than others, they know who to sell better than others.
6/11/20, 22:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: IB?
6/11/20, 22:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Investment banking
6/11/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÜ
6/11/20, 22:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Access is worth a price
6/11/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yeah. This seems a ‚Äúflipkart mafia‚Äù effect more than anything else? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6/11/20, 22:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They will probably blame it on covid-19 now! ü¶†
6/11/20, 22:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Who to sell and how to sell goes together - always!
With IBs you can bundle shit and position it as gold as long as you know who you are selling to cannot call the bluff. Or you can make them believe that shit also will turn gold
6/11/20, 22:24 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I worked with an IB and saw shit positioned as gold till the the time shit started smelling. And people bought it
6/11/20, 22:25 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: When you have a brand, Positioning products is what matters
6/11/20, 22:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Here is a very interesting real story: 
So a very good friend of mine is a lawyer in world‚Äôs second largest law firm, went to Stanford law, worked in a very large Indian law firm as well before that. While at Stanford, took a valuation class, taught by ex global MD of GS, where they were given an assignment to value Elon Musk and Tesla. (About a year / year and half back)

At the end of it the class figured that Tesla is not a car company, not a electronics company, not an AI company, not a battery company, so can‚Äôt be valued as such.

To which this famous professor quipped, since it is clearly none of them, hence it is beating all of them together in valuation.

At the end of his class, he said there are just max 6-7 widely enough accepted valuation methodologies, all of which are available online in pre-made excel sheets, so no real valuation can be made from them.

What matters is what you can make people think something is worth by doing enough signalling.
6/11/20, 22:29 - Vikas Business Phone: Good one üëç
6/11/20, 22:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not to be included in any online letters / posts please. It‚Äôs a request. But it was a very valuable lesson, hence shared.
6/11/20, 22:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Should have used Faraday as example üòÇ
6/11/20, 22:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Yes yes baba
6/11/20, 22:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Don't worry
6/11/20, 22:34 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: This is an eye opener!
6/11/20, 22:36 - Vikas Business Phone: Done lot of signalling in college days... Investor signalling is different skill.. Don't know who teaches that
6/11/20, 22:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No one teaches you, but you learn
6/11/20, 22:37 - Vikas Business Phone: Agree
6/11/20, 22:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Thanks. It was an amazing lesson hence shared. And came from someone who understands this world well yet can‚Äôt transact.

The person has been involved in some of the largest deals in India 2 years back, now does some of the largest deals in US / SF.

By the lawyers, lawyers in such positions are not allowed to trade in the US.
6/11/20, 22:39 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Prof Damodaran loves taking Tesla's example in his valuation classes
6/11/20, 22:39 - Vikas Business Phone: UTI chairman
6/11/20, 22:39 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Noooo
6/11/20, 22:41 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm
6/11/20, 22:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is only 1 value / valuation: Buyer and seller agreeing to a price. Everything else is conjecture.
6/11/20, 22:41 - Vikas Business Phone: Oh ok..
6/11/20, 22:41 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: I guess you had shared his article somewhere

6/11/20, 22:46 - Vikas Business Phone: This message was deleted
6/11/20, 22:46 - Vikas Business Phone: Important point made are  

1. Companies not acting its age.
2. Valuation is not just number but the about Story embedded (Valuation changed from 5 Billion to 53 billion when uber defined itself as logistic company) 

3. Great CEO- definition changes with life cycle of company ie Young, mature and decline 
( Eg how Steve Job benefitted by having TimCook) 

4. Cash burn is feature and not a bug for start-up. They need to make money 

5. Compressed life cycle of company( Gives an E.g. If GE and Yahoo. Yahoo saw all the life cycle in short period) 

6. Startup are like Teenage- they behave stupid 

7. Investing/ Financing/dividend as per life cycle 

8. Amazon- disruption platform. Pray that they don‚Äôt enter your business 

9. Flipkart is money losing machine

Just tooo good a post
6/11/20, 22:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 10. Flipsters follow flipkart model
6/11/20, 22:48 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: üëçüèª
6/11/20, 22:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòù

6/12/20, 12:17 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *How Can A Prudent Fiscal Policy Work When Economic Activity Itself Is At A Standstill?*

Can prudent fiscal policy & interest rate management have any meaning when economic activity is almost at a standstill? 

Well, the answer to the above question is always a yes, finance and economics always matters, even when the exchange of goods and services is less, it still exists. Also, a fiscal policy focuses to manage liquidity. And talking about liquidity, India needed liquidity regardless of the scare anyway.While it took time for countries to jump back on their feet, central banks were always making sure that liquidity and stability were maintained. It‚Äôs not to get economic activities going right now but to make sure that it‚Äôs not coming to standstill and once the situation is controlled, it‚Äôs easier to press the reset button. On investment, that will continue with a bit harsher or conservative outlook and habits may change post lockdown and more opportunity may pop up. This question also depends upon how this cycle plays out and how long core businesses can sustain.

India intents to have digitalisation in banking and aims to  extend  the banking services to wider group of the society including the lowest  stratum having high social aspirations. This is  achievable by  strengthening and empowering  the  cooperative banks with expertise and technology

We,at FIAKS, are delighted to work with the  aim to empower the  cooperative banks with technology and necessary collaborations to achieve the unified dream of inclusive  banking. In this attempt, we are  grateful to *SBM Bank India* in  supporting us in this social impact initiatives.

Here is press release that says ‚ÄúVisa is working with Facebook so that consumers can fully use the new payments feature on WhatsApp in Brazil‚Äù 


*QUESTION* Isn‚Äôt this partnership like Bank of America selling Wellsfargo saving accounts in its branches

Whatsapp can easily enable P2P and P2M payments *without* visa or Mastercard thru bank partnerships. Invite views from the community members


IMPORTANT‚è©
*Kindly note*:  _we will share one or two best responses only in Participating communities. Rest can be read in the *FIAKS bespoke* which will be released later incorporating all the views_
6/17/20, 18:34 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on- "Isn‚Äôt WHATSAPP  competitor VISA?"*

*Views 11* CXO Fintech 

It's a hark back to core competencies. 

WA has a great consumer base, they are focused on providing a great CX.

Networks are good at laying interconnecting pipes. Banks are good at acquiring consumers.

Yes, vertical integration can (and does) take place, but it takes time to build, mature and most importantly, get consumer adoption. 

Until then, the *fastest GTM* is by harnessing power of complementary players. In this case,
WA (owns consumers and CX) while
MA/V have built Send/Visa Direct pipes to various Banks/card issuers.

*Views 13* _CXO FINTECH_
Basis the earlier response I see an an agreement that What‚Äôs app & Visa/MasterCard are competing brands. Very strange to know that they are collaborating. üôÉ

*Views 16* _CXO FINTECH_ 
Yes they are competitors but when you want to be fastest in the market to launch this is the best option... even in india they have dependency on Bank and NPCI... same is in all places... bank will be involved... if bank involved then somehow Scheme is also involved...

*View 17*- CXO FINTECH 
But the product which is the fastest to go to market and has a very clean user experience wins. People are used to WA and  they will add referrals too which will help in faster adaptability


*QUESTION* - So you will help competitor go faster to market ??
6/17/20, 18:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fb & Visa competing brands?

This logic is based on what exactly?
Isnt Visa/MC the primary mode of payment for any service FB provides? ü§î

Also, Visa / MC were founding sponsors of Libra.

So, its a wrong assumption, to start with.

6/17/20, 19:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Reality no 3 is they will lose market share in the medium to long run and very fast at some point if they don‚Äôt do it - plus it can go into litigation
6/17/20, 19:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its normal business.
6/17/20, 19:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Bigbasket sells several brands of products on their store, for eg. aashirvad atta.

So, when they started selling atta in BB Royal brand, does bigbasket become competitor to aashirvad? and they should stop working with aahirvad?
6/17/20, 19:06 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: There are probably a whole generation of Visa execs who have been taught how Kodak's competition was not Canon/Nikon but Nokia or that of the airlines was Cisco/Video conferencing. And hence Visa looks at WhatsApp and says "I don't want to be Kodak" and sidles up for a collaboration :-)
6/17/20, 19:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: or should aashirvad stop selling with BB? lol
6/17/20, 19:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its like politics. there is no permanent enemy! üòù
6/17/20, 19:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Libra was too centralised. Instead I feel Libra should have become a card scheme competitor on the blockchain, with cards that hold address/key, and any "acquirer" can accept payments by having a EDC machine can authenticate that card directly on the blockchainn.
6/17/20, 19:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: no centralisation.
6/17/20, 19:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its still a potential model, for anyone with deep pockets.

6/18/20, 10:36 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Australia‚Äôs consumer watchdog said on Thursday it had concerns that *Alphabet Inc-owned Google‚Äôs planned $2.1 billion (¬£1.6 billion) acquisition of fitness tracker company Fitbit* may hinder competition in digital advertising and health markets.

The ACCC's investigation is focussed on certain online advertising services and nascent data-dependent health markets

It is the *first regulator to voice competition concerns* about the deal, although U.S. and European antitrust regulators have said they are looking at the proposed acquisition following concerns from consumer and privacy groups.

The ACCC also outlined worries over whether Google would favour its own wearable devices over competitors when suggesting services on its platforms such as WearOS, Google Maps and Google Play Store.

6/18/20, 11:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Banks Are Shut To Avoid Run On Deposits Then Why Not Stock Market Too?*

While banks fail and a moratorium is imposed upon the banks then why not a similar thing is being considered when the stock market is going down. 

It is said that stock markets are barometers of the economy, and rarely in the past, the markets over the world have been shut during big negative events. We are a part of the world market system and index funds/global funds are participating and if we close markets will lead to panic and will further slide. Even Spain and Italy have not closed markets and they are impacted more than us.

Share market is the only investment vehicle that is accessible in bad times like this. 

Other investments like real estate, gold, etc are not as a liquid even if you are ready to sell at a lower price and are accessible like stocks. The premise that by closing markets, there will be no impact is fallacious. Markets will go down even more once they reopen as we have to understand that our markets are impacted more by global flows and not domestic players.

6/19/20, 18:08 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 80*

The quest to happiness starts with awareness. Let's get ready to bust some myths!

*Statement 1*  - *FACT*
(Decluttering and organising your work space can lead to improved happiness.)

_Details:_ Research shows that cluttered spaces can have negative effects on our stress and anxiety levels, as well as our ability to focus, our eating choices, and even our sleep. It was observed that when participants cleared clutter from their work environment, they were better able to focus and process information, and their productivity increased.

*Statement 2* - *MYTH*
(Limiting daily working hours is unimportant as long as we accomplish our targets.)

_Details:_ Increasing trends in Work from Home and virtual, instant communication technologies have blurred lines between professional and personal lives. Even then, it remains crucially important to wellbeing and productivity that we maintain a good work-life balance. One way of achieving that is through fixed working hours.

*Statement 3* - *MYTH*
(It is not okay to have negative emotions like sadness, and they should be completely eliminated.)

_Details:_ Emotions are a spectrum and they are meant to be temporary. It is okay to feel sad or angry, as long as you are able to recover and bounce back. If you are unable to do so, know that getting help is not shameful. Rather, it's a sign of courage.

*Statement 4* - *MYTH*
(Taking breaks while working is always counterproductive.)

_Details:_ Everyone has their own style of working, depending on their attention span and other factors. While some of us prefer working for hours at a stretch, some benefit at taking breaks every other hour to re-energize. Being accommodative of different working styles will boost workplace productivity.

*Statement 5* - *MYTH*
(Depressive symptoms are the same for all individuals.)

_Details:_ Every single individual has a different experience of how they go through mental illnesses, be it anxiety, depression or any other problem. Just because a person is lonely doesn't mean they are depressed. Just because someone is extroverted does not mean they are not depressed. There are a few telling signs of depression but they might be difficult to tell if the individual unconsciously/ actively masks the symptoms.

Mental Health does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. We are all living in times of extreme stress and uncertainty. It is all the more important to develop empathy.

üëâüèΩ Listen. Listen to what your coworkers have to say.
üëâüèΩ Create an inclusive, healthy workspace.
üëâüèΩ It is alright to take a time-out for yourself.
üëâüèΩ 'Happy' is not the only positive emotion. Try to feel grateful, inspired, hopeful when the going gets tough. 
üëâüèΩ Be sensitive. Be aware.

Have a resourceful day ahead!üí´

6/22/20, 18:23 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Why Are GDP Calculations So Confusing?*

We have GDP of X in year 1. It will become Y in year 2. The difference between Y and X is growth. Secondly, we don‚Äôt have equal GDP per day or months in terms of production (an output basis for GDP) or consumption (another way). Most of the consumption continues, at least for essential goods. So as demand picks up, it will recover part of the lost ground.

Now coming back to economics, the 1900s first half great depression was overcome through increased government spending. Unless the government does not contribute substantially to business confidence, the economy may enter into a recession.

https://bit.ly/3hLGnsC
6/22/20, 18:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: GDP calculations are not confusing.
GDP calculations are inadequate measure of economy.
GDP calculates trade not production of goods and services.

6/24/20, 11:28 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Should Customer Credit Score Be Impacted By Wallet Subscriptions Shown As Loan?*

Should credit score be based on such wallet subscriptions? This is really a problem. It‚Äôs an incorrect way to show lending. It should be based on actual loan taken not based on such wallets. There are thousands of wallets that we subscribe to. So there is no control and we don‚Äôt use these very frequently.

By definition, any service where you don‚Äôt pay upfront is credit. So, it should affect credit. Whether you utilize credit or not, as long as you been approved for credit, it should be on your credit report, right?

He is asking anonymously 

*Q1* What happens to *Whatsapp- Jio* plan in India ? Kindly note this time Indian regulators will be facing not whatsapp executives but Reliance official. 

*Q2* Will regulators start to rethink on regulating  the companies like Google Pay who are not a payment system operator as per them?

*Q3* Are we heading for *Digital Pandemic* and probable *Digital Isolation* for blunders that may happen in the payments space by allowing non-regulated entities thru sponsor bank relationships. Especially when sponsoring bank has little control on the system used to by these non-banking entities that directs them to *Debit and credit customer accounts*?

*Views 12*

I think the regulator should take the third party apps into its ambit and should regulate these companies like a seperate category with specific  guidelines and rules... Or as an old thinking which everyone including in the RBI and fintech professionals has already discussed and dusted in the FIAKS community,, can we have a *SEPERATE REGULATORS FOR SUCH 3rd PARTY APPS*.. To ensure there is a fair game for all...

6/24/20, 20:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Am surprised they moved from soft pos to a edc! 

With upi / bharatQR catching on, card is becoming much less relevant domestically.
6/24/20, 21:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because horse - cycle - motor cycle - car

6/24/20, 21:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Also, card prevalence is probably higher now among 50+ age bracket.
6/24/20, 21:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Credit against Merchant a/c performance is established model in the us, but thats a diff market running on credit cards.

Thats only catch with upi
6/24/20, 21:02 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Too early to call any such victory I would think. At least not based on what we see today

6/24/20, 21:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am just talking valuation, of the fruition of the valuation, is resulting revenue, or someone buying it to protect their revenues is a different story

6/24/20, 21:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Daddy shall be called for sure but the truth is transactions will be free or nearly free, in one way or the other
6/24/20, 21:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Important part being I don‚Äôt think government will want to stop this from happening
6/24/20, 21:08 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: That's the problem people making chess moves rather than solving real problems. I am in no way saying BharatPe isn't solving real problems... If they indeed can create model to serve the merchant category they are present in better banking / lending, it is a real problem and a potentially rewarding one
6/24/20, 21:08 - +91 90233 89243: Bharatpe model was all about merchants, here with all freebies they are kind of making it a habit for merchants to use the PoS rather than the qr ?
6/24/20, 21:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Banking lobby might get some help from super daddy but not sure if that will help in super long term at all, I am sure a lot of people are going to panic very fast
6/24/20, 21:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think this is important to solve
6/24/20, 21:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The world moves because credit goes to people who create product and services
6/24/20, 21:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India is a place where this allocation is massively F-ed up
6/24/20, 21:09 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: More transactions, more data, better ability to underwrite, physical presence to help collection.

If you can solve ability to pay, intent to pay and have a field force to help collection. It can be powerful
6/24/20, 21:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Across the board so it really needs absolute rate translation from big daddy to its children and if need be even get adopted children to deliver what it needs and wants

They are also proposing to hold the funds for 15-30 days in lieu of giving txns free. So it's not so straightforward. Will be definitely interesting space to watch.
6/24/20, 22:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes agreed that‚Äôs why interesting
6/24/20, 22:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its illegal, if u ask me
6/24/20, 22:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they are using merchant settlement as float, to lend that money to others
6/24/20, 22:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its bit ponzi-like
6/24/20, 22:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they are giving free mdt, for late settlement
6/24/20, 22:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and then, offering loans.
6/24/20, 22:27 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: RBI regulations if I remember are very clear on the when the merchant settlement have to be cleared
6/24/20, 22:29 - Vikas Business Phone: But if merchant signs on document that states in bold that "he explicitly agrees to it and is perfectly fine holding funds for 15 to 30 days" 

That is not illegal or violation of any RBI rules
6/24/20, 22:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: exactly why I said its probably illegal.. so, technically, they are taking deposits from merchants, to lend to others..
6/24/20, 22:30 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Makes sense. They do make money, one way or the other. But under the new guidelines on PA, they won't be able to continue this as there is a clear requirement of final settlement in td +1 day
6/24/20, 22:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: onnly if that money is in non-interest bearing current accounnt with a bannk
6/24/20, 22:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: you cannot lennd that money, if i remember tight
6/24/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: escrow account*
6/24/20, 22:31 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: It will be. The guidelines define td as date of confirmation by the merchant to the intermediary about delivery of goods to the customer.
6/24/20, 22:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Funds in escrow so let bank decide what to do that money
6/24/20, 22:32 - Vikas Business Phone: Payment company will have arrangement with escrow account provider
6/24/20, 22:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What if there are two transactions - one that goes from A then to B
6/24/20, 22:32 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Yes. Funds in an escrow account. Interest can be earned on core portion
6/24/20, 22:33 - Vikas Business Phone: Correct
6/24/20, 22:33 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: You mean payment aggregation funds and lending from same account?
6/24/20, 22:33 - Vikas Business Phone: Not linked on paper
6/24/20, 22:34 - Vikas Business Phone: Ie no document to prove that
6/24/20, 22:35 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: True, if not linked on paper, nothing comes out in audits, no reporting and then rbi won't come to know....
6/24/20, 22:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs not about coming to know or not know
6/24/20, 22:45 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Then, could you please explain... Because under the ambit of the law, its illegal

6/24/20, 22:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs like fighting gravity
6/24/20, 22:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It won‚Äôt work, perhaps can delayed by some time at best but it won‚Äôt work
6/24/20, 22:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The reality is that payment processors need to get their rates down way more to be even competing with new age businesses
6/24/20, 22:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If they don‚Äôt do it then they are just ensuring that they eventually die
6/24/20, 22:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats illegal. you cannot leverage escrow funds. thats the whole point of having an escrow! üòÇ
6/24/20, 22:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: segregated funds have to be segregated from bank risk too. thats why its meant to be non-interest bearing.
6/24/20, 22:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The other way to look at is that the POS provider will find a way to take the money from the account, you can‚Äôt stop it from happening if both parties agree
6/24/20, 22:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There are a million ways to enable this because it‚Äôs just naturally more efficient than the current system
6/24/20, 22:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: till u ask ann auditor to sign off on it..
6/24/20, 22:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this sounds like USDT..
6/24/20, 22:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they said USDT is fully backed
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is exactly that
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And that‚Äôs the point
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: USDT or USDT equivalent is the reality of the flat world
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: con
6/24/20, 22:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: then, they took loans in lien of the deposit..
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: u cannt get away with that, in a domestic environmennt
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In which case a better loan provider will make things happen? Isn‚Äôt it?
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Payment processing is going to be a 0% businesses
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: fractional reserve is for banks. not for psps and wallets.
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: At best with a flat fee per unit
6/24/20, 22:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs just in our heads
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Fractional reserve is for folks who agree that there is trust between two parties
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats the main difference
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if PSPs and wallets are allowed to risk 3rd party funds
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: they are essentially banks
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And this discussion will become too esoteric for others to follow, economically speaking, so not sure if this is right forum
6/24/20, 22:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What if the risk is guaranteed?
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: by whom?
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What if it‚Äôs in lieu of other service cost equivalent?
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what control do they have over the borrower?
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There a million ways of giving the same cost back
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what happens when borrower default? an unrelated merchant loses his settlement?
6/24/20, 22:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Can‚Äôt happen because it‚Äôs just float
6/24/20, 22:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs not buying a security
6/24/20, 22:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: why wouldnt it?
6/24/20, 22:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, bank is assuming risk of borrower?
6/24/20, 22:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and bharatpe is only helping bank with a higher deposit figure, by asking merchants to hold their settlements longer?
6/24/20, 22:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: lol
6/24/20, 22:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: One way yes, other way, bank pays BharatPe
6/24/20, 22:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hundreds of other ways
6/24/20, 22:59 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Recently a scam was discovered- Karvy had lien marked Rs.100s of crores of Retail investors and HDFC had lent against it
6/24/20, 22:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs the point
6/24/20, 23:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: My principle assumption is the structure of payment processors and banks are too heavy
6/24/20, 23:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its amazing how much fraud happens inn these bakns, despite it leaving a paper trail

6/24/20, 23:01 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: And some people come out and do postmortem on it üòâüòÉ
6/24/20, 23:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: theres playing the rules and doing complete fraud.
6/24/20, 23:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: these obviously belongs to the later category! lol
6/24/20, 23:05 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Basically, the moral of the story is - if you can generate a good float consistently in the escrow account - you can arm twist your Bank to give credit
6/24/20, 23:05 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Exactly
6/24/20, 23:07 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: And the bank also need to provide banker's certificate on the escrow account. So I guess you'll have to ask the bank also
6/24/20, 23:11 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Hmm
6/24/20, 23:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Business model hai
6/24/20, 23:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Bank can say no also
6/24/20, 23:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If they don‚Äôt then it‚Äôs a call they are taking
6/24/20, 23:13 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Exactly

6/25/20, 19:28 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: This is the standard practise all vendors are using while processing refunds. Even credit card companies are using the similar tactics to use money float.üòÇ
6/25/20, 20:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
6/25/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 1 - Most companies are going this way, PGs are also trying to enable it, companies however have to bear the cost of transaction to and fro and because of change in medium - Like a card type to pg to card processor to bank account but the refund will be via net banking mostly. This is actually more about cost than about speed, as far as I can see it from my limited perspective. The time is essentially a deterrent against cancellation. In short everybody in the value chain gains by being hand in glove therefore no incentive to solve this.

2. Displaying what they can‚Äôt deliver is either a technical error because their SAP / SAP equivalent system isn‚Äôt updated in real time (actual issue mostly) / or they want to know what people want to order but is out of stock (Amazon)

3. Ecomm companies enjoy float because no one has challenged them in court but this float will go away soon either because of competition or because of legal cases in the future forward, otherwise they will have to pay the vendor or customer. This is just bound to happen.

4. Regulator and it will happen
6/25/20, 20:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also Ecomm companies will go this way because of competition sooner or later, no choice

*View 15* _CXO Banker_  üáÆüá≥ 

Well I guess the parties involved in the refund process are the ecom company (merchant aggregator), the merchant, merchant‚Äôs banker, ecom company‚Äôs banker, and the customer‚Äôs bank. Plus NPCI most likely or an equivalent router.

So this 6-way recon may take time. At each level if it takes T+1 to recon&settle back&forth, the refund duration adds up to 7 days. Add a couple of days buffer.

That said, even as I write this, this process sounds reeeally *ANCIENT*

*View 23*: _CXO Banker UAE_ üá¶üá™

It‚Äôs all parties as they require reconciliation of the entire transaction before it is refunded.. having said that if automation is put in place to reconcile them the timeline significantly reduces to instant refund for straight through cases and at a maximum of regulatory 2 working days for suspect cases

6/25/20, 21:42 - Vikas Business Phone: üëçüëç
6/25/20, 21:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Aggregators enjoy float, aggregators are Ecomm companies.
6/25/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They enjoy anywhere between 3 days to 10 days of float on B2B side of a B2B2C platform.
6/25/20, 21:44 - Vikas Business Phone: Oh ok
6/25/20, 21:44 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Not in case of refunds
6/25/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Correct but in case of all money transacted by default, which is way higher than refunds - I am calling out the practice.
6/25/20, 21:45 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Most Ecom wants instant refunds
6/25/20, 21:46 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Depends on the business model. Quite a few have negative cash flow where we even lend money.
6/25/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Both of these would be parallel realities
6/25/20, 21:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can be lending money because of negative cash flow and yet they can be enjoying float for 10-15 days from their vendors
6/25/20, 21:47 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Yeah.. so it's not to do with people or intention but business model.
6/25/20, 21:47 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: No... In case of negative cash flow it's reverse
6/25/20, 21:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Correct / It is the business model
6/25/20, 21:47 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: They have to buy first and pay their vendors
6/25/20, 21:47 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Like OTAs
6/25/20, 21:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is not true for any on demand products
6/25/20, 21:47 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: They have to pay airlines first to buy inventory
6/25/20, 21:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For anything with inventory, yes
6/25/20, 21:48 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Yup.
6/25/20, 21:48 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Even rent collection agencies.
6/25/20, 21:48 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: They prefer paying rent or utility asap.
6/25/20, 21:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So there are business models which use this loophole to circle money where there is no inventory to buy or hold at all
6/25/20, 21:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In fact even their refund is within an usual TAT of 2 mins to 24 hours, they withhold the money as a business policy, without exemplifying the need to do so (which is part of the implicit business model)
6/25/20, 21:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes that makes absolute sense
6/25/20, 21:55 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Completely agree with Shashank. 
1. e-commerce doesnt enjoy any float
2. A lot of ecomms now ‚Äúreverse the txn‚Äù and not transfer thru NB. 
3.  Often while the TAT is given as 7days the actual TAT is often 48 hours for a majority of txns
4. Often issuer banks take time to credit the money to the account
6/25/20, 21:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So assume there is a company that delivers
1. Food
2. Grocery
3. Hair cut

Customer pays now, money in credit in 15 days to provider to vendor, but customer has 1 hour to raise complaint.

Does the aggregator enjoy float?
6/25/20, 22:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All of these services are bought and sold in real time without inventory, just to give an example
6/25/20, 22:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There are two ways to enjoy the float, from the customer side and vendor side, the largest float is from the vendor side almost always, not the customer side.
6/25/20, 23:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Again gap in your understanding. 
Lets take your examples. 

When you cancel a food order to Swiggy, they  take up a case with the Payment aggregator  (Depending on the Aggregator, swiggy may be debited instantly)
, which may connect to the PG, which inturns talks to their acquiring bank.
Which takes up with the issuing bank for refunds and settlements. A lot of these are batch processes that run nightly causing a delay. However a lot of these are real time as well.  Alot of razor pay refunds are online. 
Even in cases where the money at swiggys end may remain with swiggy for a day, its ‚Äúnot created by them to enjoy float‚Äù but a systemic process. 

There is also a concept of transaction reversal that is done by several merchant, Aggregators, banks tht happens within a few hours.
6/25/20, 23:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Also in a case like above when an order is cancelled, the merchants money (essentially restaurants) may not have been credited (generally happens in settlement cycles). And thus an aggregator like swiggy keeping the money is generally not the case.
6/25/20, 23:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: In a nut shell,
1. Payments systems definitely have gotten better. There are razorpay like payment aggregators who have made the proesses mear real time. 
2. Merchants also need to do a better job at communicating. Sometimes tat is often bloated to set customer expectation and reduce customer support load. 
3. The largest delay is often between acquiring and issusing banks and this needs to improve
6/26/20, 00:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Non-cancellations
6/26/20, 00:44 - Vikas Business Phone: Great discussions .. üëçüëç
6/26/20, 00:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: these are justifications a php/bank would give for delayed refunds.

let the RBI mandate that credits have to reflect in same timeframe as debits.  magically. everything will be possible then! üòè

fact is - there is no tech limitation to providing instant refunds. delays are business decisions that are convenient to the PSPs/banks! period.
6/26/20, 00:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is not just about refunds, it‚Äôs about settlement.
6/26/20, 00:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: merchant initiated refunds are 0-risk, 0-liability for psp/bank. 
any delay is free money to banks.
6/26/20, 00:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If product or service has a guarantee return within period N, settlement should be period N + Buffer
6/26/20, 00:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That buffer can‚Äôt be 100N
6/26/20, 00:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Today product cancellation is real time and so is a lot of return btw, but the aggregator monopolises the entire settlement process and doesn‚Äôt give vendor money - I am pretty sure this is not a problem from the banking or PG side beyond a fairly okish N period
6/26/20, 00:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No hyperlocal product, as an example, has return policy over 1 hour to 1 day, settlement policy is 10 days.
6/26/20, 00:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Of course competition at some point will offset this but I am guessing RBI will come in at some point and take a note either by itself or because of some litigation in court.
6/26/20, 01:50 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Seems we‚Äôre talking different things
6/26/20, 07:53 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Absolutely agree. And we see some great examples of payment systems + merchants helping that cause of real-time refunds. 
Absolutely the refund process need to get better. 

The point I am making is in todays times, a marketplace is not really making floats out of this.
6/26/20, 07:59 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The second point I am making is it not the merchant or marketplace that is often causing delays in reversals of funds. Its the delay between PG Acquiring and Issusing banks. 
Should this improve, absolutely

6/27/20, 01:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: To banking and finance enthusiasts here: Found a very interesting (sort of unfortunate) series of new rates that RBI prescribes that most of us don‚Äôt know about because these didn‚Äôt exist for most part of history:

Generally in financial economics, we get to mandatorily study (or at least asked to study) CRR and SLR, and then RR and RRR subsequently, and historically for India, one more called PLR. Then came BR and BPLR.

Now very recently it seems it has even furthered its endeavours to ensure kids have more to study in schools / colleges and therefore introduced - MCLR, RLLR, and EBLR. In case you want to know what these esoteric things are just search the terms online, I happily changed upon them while reading one of my college‚Äôs prof‚Äôs article in Finacial Express today.

6/29/20, 14:25 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: From Financial Times: ‚ÄúEY failed on basic Witecard checks - ‚Ä¢lapses in Singapore; ‚Ä¢bank statements not seen for 5 years; ‚Ä¢pivotal role of Asia accounts‚Äù

EY failed for more than three years to request crucial account information from a Singapore bank where Wirecard claimed it had up to ‚Ç¨1bn in cash ‚Äî a routine audit procedure that could have uncovered the vast fraud at the German payments group.

The accountancy firm, which audited Wirecard for a decade, has come under fire after the once high-flying fintech company filed for insolvency this week, revealing that ‚Ç¨1.9bn in cash probably did ‚Äúnot exist‚Äù. 

People with first-hand knowledge told the Financial Times that the auditor between 2016 and 2018 did not check directly with Singapore‚Äôs OCBC Bank to confirm that the lender held large amounts of cash on behalf of Wirecard. Instead, EY relied on documents and screenshots provided by a third-party trustee and Wirecard itself. 

Wirecard is the latest scandal to embroil a Big Four accounting firm.
‚ÄúThe big question for me is what on earth did EY do when they signed off the accounts?‚Äù said a senior banker at a lender with credit exposure to Wirecard. 

A senior auditor at another firm said that obtaining independent confirmation of bank balances was ‚Äúequivalent to day-one training at audit school‚Äù. 

OCBC declined to comment. A person briefed on the details told the Financial Times that Wirecard has no banking relationship with OCBC and that the fintech‚Äôs former Singapore-based trustee does not have an escrow account with the bank. The lender did not receive any query from EY in relation to Wirecard between 2016 and 2018, the person added.

The Big Four accounting firm had issued unqualified audits of Wirecard for a decade despite increasing questions over suspect accounting practices from journalists and short sellers. 

An ‚Äúout of country‚Äù team at EY is reviewing the work carried out by its German auditors, according to a person close to the firm.

The German accounting watchdog FREP is probing Wirecard‚Äôs balance sheet, and the country‚Äôs auditor oversight body APAS has begun looking into EY‚Äôs work. EY declined to comment on the regulatory investigation and details of its work. FREP and APAS declined to comment. 

The purported accounts at Asian banks play a pivotal role in Wirecard‚Äôs accounting fraud that culminated in the group filing for insolvency on Thursday. 
According to the company‚Äôs former management, the accounts were used to settle transactions with partners who acted on Wirecard‚Äôs behalf in countries where it did not have its own licences to process electronic payments. Yet it is now unclear if the accounts ‚Äî let alone the money allegedly deposited there ‚Äî ever existed.

Wirecard had told its auditors that the money moved late last year from OCBC to banks in the Philippines, where supposedly there was now ‚Ç¨1.9bn deposited.

A special audit by KPMG could not obtain original documents from the banks to prove deposits existed. EY was told this month by the banks that paperwork it had previously seen on the Philippine accounts was ‚Äúspurious‚Äù and they did not exist.

The head of audit at a rival accounting firm to EY said: ‚ÄúIt is beyond the realms of reality that EY wouldn‚Äôt have had [the bank balance confirmations] unless they did a very poor audit. Cash is easy to audit. If investors can‚Äôt trust the cash number, what can they trust?‚Äù

In a statement issued on Thursday, EY said there were ‚Äúclear indications that this was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud, involving multiple parties around the world in different institutions, with a deliberate aim of deception‚Äù. The company argued that ‚Äúeven the most robust audit procedures may not uncover this kind of fraud‚Äù.

Hansrudi Lenz, professor of accounting at W√ºrzburg university, told the Financial Times that it was ‚Äúnot sufficient‚Äù for an auditor to rely on account confirmations that were provided by third parties. ‚ÄúThe auditor needs to have full control over the delivery of account confirmation,‚Äù he said, adding that this was stipulated by procedural guidelines.

Germany‚Äôs small shareholder lobby group SdK on Friday said it filed criminal complaints against the EY auditors who signed Wirecard‚Äôs accounts between 2016 and 2018, accusing them of violating professional duties.

Accounts published by Wirecard showed that five different EY partners signed its accounts over the past five years. Among them is Andreas Loetscher, who co-led EY‚Äôs audits into Wirecard between 2015 and 2017 and a year later joined Deutsche Bank as chief accounting officer.

Deutsche Bank said: ‚ÄúThere are many open questions with regard to Wirecard. We highly appreciate our work with Andreas Loetscher. Moreover‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâthe presumption of innocence of course applies to him as well.‚Äù 

Wirecard insolvency, Brussels to probe German regulator, Federal Reserve bans buybacks
EY is already facing a class-action lawsuit in Germany brought by Wirecard investors. Wolfgang Schirp, a Berlin-based lawyer who is working on the case against the audit firm, said: ‚ÄúIt is frightening how long Wirecard was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors. We have been monitoring Wirecard since 2008 and have collected very extensive material. It was always clear that something was wrong.‚Äù

Akshay Naheta, a SoftBank executive who led an investment in Wirecard last year, attacked EY on Twitter last week. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally baffled by the lack of competence and responsibility displayed by E&Y,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs an organisation that is meant to protect all stakeholders ‚Äî creditors and shareholders ‚Äî in companies, both public and private, they have materially failed in their fiduciary duties.‚Äù

For years EY has said it wants to expand its roster of clients on Germany‚Äôs DAX 30 index as it audits fewer companies than its rivals KPMG and PwC. EY earned nearly ‚Ç¨10m for its audits of Wirecard over the past decade.

The Wirecard fraud is one of several international accounting scandals that have emerged on EY‚Äôs watch this year, including at NMC Health and Luckin Coffee.

I don't think there is enough information to make any comments...

The banks are cautious and will disburse only after documentation and hypothecation is completed...

Let's track the delay from that date.

In my several years in a bank, I have noticed that there is pressure to disburse loans without documentation being completed in. Majority of the cases... Once disbursement is done then the bank continues to follow up with the customer for documentation...

*Why can't the customer complete the documentation as it is spelt out in sanction terms and then ask for disbursement?*

This is particularly risky today, since most cyber attacks target unpatched app versions https://www.news18.com/news/tech/59-chinese-apps-banned-tiktok-users-heres-what-will-happen-to-your-app-now-2693343.html
6/29/20, 22:55 - Fintech Monica Jasuja Mastercard IiNC: Patches will not be available so apps will not function when a version upgrade happens

6/29/20, 22:58 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
6/29/20, 23:02 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: To be clear, the govt could do 2 things
1. Ban new downloads/updates
2. Also blacklist ports/IPs so that the users who may already have the app may not be able to access content on these apps
6/29/20, 23:09 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
6/29/20, 23:11 - Fintech Monica Jasuja Mastercard IiNC: I thought #2 is the only option however that is yet to be validated on the news and official channels
6/29/20, 23:13 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: CERT and MEITY would likely be issuing order to Apple and Google to bring down these Apps. I have seen this happening in the past for a specific App; although never for such a long list
6/29/20, 23:15 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
6/29/20, 23:15 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectuals Speak on 59 App Ban*

*View 7*  Serial entrepreneur, PE/VC founder  and investor in several start-up says 

I'm guessing B is enough.and A and B are the same - Appstore/Playstore download links just point to the app website anyway

*FIAKS QUESTION* 

C) If i am an existing customer tiktok or Any of these 59 apps then what happens 

_I cant access it ?_


D) If i  today try to download tiktok or Any of these 59 apps app now then 

_It will not allow me to download ?_

*RESPONSE*

I don't know the details but my guess is that if you are an existing user and try to open the app, any data on your phone you can access, but it can't make any server connection. 

You won't be allowed to download any app on an Indian ISP. I guess if you setup a VPN and logged in from another country it would still work - that's how folks in the Middle East use VOIP calling.
6/29/20, 23:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Another thing. These apps will *eventually* be banned. As of now the govt has only issued a press release. This is generally followed by orders to stores and ISPs

6/29/20, 23:31 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
6/29/20, 23:35 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The last part is NOT entirely correct. Its not just the VPN that connects with App Downloads. On Appstore there is a concept of a country. If your account is setup for India, and if the Govt asks Apple/Google to remove, irrespective of the VPN country, one would not see these apps for downloads on the India store
6/29/20, 23:36 - Vikas Business Phone: Oh. Great üëçüëç
6/30/20, 03:04 - Vikas Business Phone: Sandeep hope you queries are responded
6/30/20, 03:04 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Are there previous instances of a Government asking Google or Apple to remove apps and they have complied? China has of course banned some social media apps but is that at AppStore level or network level.

If any country decides to ban apps at a country level then it will be a thorny issue for AppStores because they approved the app in the first place. 

This also creates a dangerous precedent. If one country can ask for an app to be banned from downloading then so can others. Furthermore, this does not prevent the app developer from making the app available via alternate AppStores or direct download image (though it does get technical for most regular users beyond this point)
6/30/20, 03:08 - Vikas Business Phone: Am told the ISPs sometimes don't really do a great job of blocking as the blocked sites come up with mirror sites that are usually open. Community member says don't ask me how I know üòÄ

6/30/20, 03:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this is most relevant to apple. in android, do apps already installed get deleted/disabled?
6/30/20, 03:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its so easy if u on services like AWS
6/30/20, 03:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i was wondering the same. when do you sleep @919930386859 ??
6/30/20, 03:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: app store banning annd site/ip banninng are 2 diff ballgames..
6/30/20, 07:16 - +91 90233 89243: Does removal of an app for one country exist?
6/30/20, 07:19 - +91 90233 89243: Afaik, there is an option for removal of country from the supported country list.
6/30/20, 08:08 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: so this TIktok ban introduction ( I  do not use this app). I got curious  to know about it , and the numbers are amazing, about 460 million users in India, each  spends an average  of  about an hour!!.  


Talk about Mindshare!!


https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/
6/30/20, 08:12 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Exactly. And so it will be interesting to see how GoI enforces this ban.
6/30/20, 08:14 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Especially given that it‚Äôs not one app they‚Äôre up against but a whole bunch of them. ISPs would have little option but to comply with filtering directives. The same does not apply to Apple and Google as the AppStores are not local entities.
6/30/20, 08:16 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Another question, how will China retaliate?
6/30/20, 08:17 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: If they ban their exports to India, we'll be rogered
6/30/20, 08:18 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: That will be very extreme.
6/30/20, 08:19 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: No, the retaliation scale has to be commensurate. If you look at it, most of these apps are entertainment and utility related and have no impact on  economy.
6/30/20, 08:20 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: It's about having information/data in the garb of entertainment
6/30/20, 08:20 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: They will lose 50bn USD per annum to start with.
6/30/20, 08:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: could backfire.. that sort of retaliation, could incite a response from other countries as well..
6/30/20, 08:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and that.. lol
6/30/20, 08:20 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I agree. Even for India this is mostly a PR gesture as it doesn't affect anything seriously. Some equivalent PR oriented step from China is to be expected, and likely nothing beyond that
6/30/20, 08:21 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: The closest, US has a war, to it's soil, is Pearl Harbour
6/30/20, 08:22 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: US will be more than happy to fuel this friction
6/30/20, 08:22 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: While trying to look like an ally
6/30/20, 08:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: on the bright side, covid-situation is encouraging every society to be self-sufficient and not just at a  nation-level.. even on a state-level.. hyperlocal and local-b2b could really pick up..
6/30/20, 08:24 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: On brighter side, Jio may increase it's user base üòâ
6/30/20, 08:26 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I am hoping it does the opposite. Shows how big a role migrants play,  whether domestically or otherwise. This will probably allow rhetoric to get better calibrated to avoid alienating them (barring the US election season where all reason gets thrown out)
6/30/20, 08:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: considering advancement in military tech, china-hawaii is about 1/3rd the distance apart, as japan-hawaii was 70 years back!! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6/30/20, 08:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i wasnt specifically referring to manpower.. more on the production side.

6/30/20, 08:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: HK national security law has just passed.. things are going to get interesting..
6/30/20, 08:35 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Yup. Lots of foreign capital in HK

6/30/20, 08:37 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: ~$4 Trillion market cap
6/30/20, 08:41 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: What exactly is the Chinese end-game?
Extreme short sighted opportunism?
Petty squabbles at the expense of established trade, commerce and goodwill?
Why?
Doesn't make sense. Missing something.
Something incredibly naive or sinister?
6/30/20, 08:44 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Will go with the latter. We have to be very vary of it's diversion tactics !
6/30/20, 08:56 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: It's strange. Chronology is interesting.

China spends billions and years establishing itself as a manufacturing/supply hub for the world.

US places restrictions.

HK boils over.

Covid becomes their biggest export.

International trade must have come to a grinding halt.

They turn up their military aggression.

- But this move should make things worse, not better. Then why are they doing it?

7/2/20, 16:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Looking for insights:

Corporate credit card is something we have all discussed at some point who are founders or even who manage P/Ls and that trend has picked up worldwide, including in India, however the terms of corporate credit cards is so abysmally bad that most folks who can calculate enough finance wouldn‚Äôt touch (unless they are very young and very small at GMV level).

So what I see as difference is on credit limits:
Corporate credit cards talk about 25 K to 5 L vs some say 1% transaction value vs personal credit cards in multiple forms sometimes have over 10 L available on account. Between 2/3 founders this credit limit can go up 20-25 L

There seems to be no added benefits that corporate credit cards accrue over personal credit cards like points or miles etc.

Corporate credit cards have ~14-15% annual interest rate vs personal credit cards have a 35-42% annual interest rates, which is the only real benefit, but is the business then betting on delinquency and credit defaults?

This is across all new players in the game and not specific to one player, I have personally spoken to at least 3-5 very bright teams, all of whom have some banking experience, solving this problem.

A youngster was attending a video conference with his Manager who was upset over the background noises. The Youngster turned around and told his grandmother to keep quiet. 

She walked towards the youngster, to take a look into what he was doing and saw a person on the Monitor and asked, ‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù

The youngster muted his audio and video and said, ‚ÄúHe is my Manager‚Äù.

She said, ‚ÄúI want to talk to your Manager‚Äù. But the youngster denied. By the time the Manager started pinging the youngster and the youngster unmuted to talk and his grandmother shouted, ‚ÄúManager I want to talk to you".

The Manager agreed and the youngster unmuted the video. The grandmother, with a smile said, ‚ÄúNamaskara‚Äù and introduced herself and the Manager also greeted her.

She said, ‚ÄúYou look upset‚Äù. 

The Manager said, ‚ÄúYeah, some kind of work tension, a lot of noise around your house and we are not able complete the meeting in time‚Äù.

The Grand Mother asked, ‚ÄúMay I help solve your problem?‚Äù

Her grandson was stopping her and telling her to keep quiet.

The Manager said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, let her speak‚Äù.

The Grandmother narrated, ‚ÄúOnce there was a Young man, who sat under a tree for taking rest. He was continuously hearing a bird‚Äôs sound. He lifted his head and seeing a bird, started chasing it, so that he could peacefully take some rest. The bird came closer to him and said, ‚ÄúYou are taking rest under my nest. I will not ask you to leave this place but you should learn to co-exist with us‚Äù.

The Grandmother looked at both of them and said, ‚ÄúYour Home is your nest‚Äù where you are supposed to take rest and bond with your dear and near ones. I do understand the Covid-19 situation, but you should also understand that our home is not your office. 

*When we come to visit our family members at your office place, we are expected to behave professionally or maintain a certain decorum.*

Similarly, when you are using our home for your office work, you should understand the situation at our home.

There is nothing wrong with working from home, but remember, it is the family members benevolent nature, that is keeping the corporate world functioning today and the economy running.

She looked at the manager and asked, ‚ÄúAm I correct ?‚Äù

*The Manager‚Äôs mother peeped and said "You are absolutely right‚Äù.* üëçüòä

Japanese supercomputer *Fugaku* zipped past all competitors to claim the top spot in the twice-annual ranking of the world's most powerful computational machines released by research project *Top500*. 

Fugaku, which was developed by *Fujitsu* in cooperation with the federal *RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS)*, was able to perform almost three times as many computations per second as former leader of the list, U.S.-based supercomputer Summit. The supercomputer also had the most cores of all computers ranked, the highest theoretical peak performance for computations and the highest power capacity.

Speaking at the ISC 2020 conference in June, Satoshi Matsuoka, Director of R-CCS, said that although Fugaku was scheduled to start up next year, *Japan‚Äôs government decided it should be deployed now to help combat Covid-19*. He cited that it was being used to study how the virus behaves, what existing drugs might be repurposed to counter it, and how a vaccine could be made.

While the United States and China compete to create the world‚Äôs most powerful computers, a Japanese supercomputer, dubbed Fugaku, took first place in Top500‚Äôs speed ranking. At the Kobe-based RIKEN Center for Computational Science, Fugaku achieved 2.8 times more calculations per second than the previous speediest system, IBM‚Äôs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Fugaku, which pushed another IBM computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to third place, is based on *SOFTBANK‚Äôs ARM chip technology*.

The barriers to digital transformation, as perceived by executives, are ranked by proportion as follows: 

*1A-2B-3C-4D-5E*

*A - 1.* Lack of digital skills (93%)
*B - 2* Cultural and Behavioral Factors (85%)
*C - 3.* Lack of understanding of digital trends (77%)
*D - 4.* Organisational structure not aligned (75%)
*E - 5.* Inadequate IT infrastructure (68%)

We all could use a little laugh, couldn't we! As the third hint mentioned, the answer was hidden in the questionüòÑ

Cornerstone Advisors undertook a study of executives to understand the perception of digital transformation in the banking sector. A whopping 93% of the executives responded that lack of digital skills was a barrier! As Ron Shevlin (MD of Fintech Research at Cornerstone Advisors) puts it,
 _"The path to digital transformation isn‚Äôt‚Äîand won‚Äôt be‚Äîa straight line. We‚Äôll see periods of faster transformation followed by slower periods as institutions reach and adapt to changes."_

Digital transformation is a structural change with *4 primary requirements:*
Complete overhaul of legacy technology, Maturation of A.I., A new generation of senior execs, and More shocks to the system (in addition to the current crisis). 

Therefore, the popular notion that the current crisis has helped accelerate the digital transformation of banking needs a severe reality check along with sustained efforts to actually realise the process.

While everyone is witnessing this gut-wrenching pandemic and every country is almost agitated over China and have literally learned big lessons from the current situation. One such region is Africa which is now moving away from China. 

China has traditionally influenced information operations, economic dependency, and its relationships with African elites to put down criticism and reshape the situation to its advantage. This pandemic moment offers the best opportunity to escape the strangulating grip of these unhelpful partners. It‚Äôs quite simple and kind of an eye-opener to all the economies around the world struggling through this pandemic to initiate steps and lower down influences of any kind and move towards the path of recovery.

7/14/20, 11:02 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Contactless Payments Without PIN: Should It Be A Default Option?*

A lot of banks issue contact type card even now to most customers and contactless is offered to only those who demand it. What if customers don‚Äôt want the default option as ‚ÄòNO PIN‚Äô. The default option must be ‚Äòwith PIN‚Äô. Isn‚Äôt this something like earlier payment gateway default option was store card details which are now changed to asking the customer ‚Äúclick here to store your card so that you need not have to re-enter card details‚Äù

Default cannot be decided based on the opinion of one person. And it‚Äôs hard to tell what the majority wants and what‚Äôs good for them from a distance. Some prefer having contactless without PIN as a default option and some want it the other way round. Well, the middle ground could be giving this setting per card on the net banking portal.

The worry is not only for the loans under moratorium... Larger worry is the declining capacity of all borrowers to make timely  repayment to remain compliant to prudential norms... Moratorium is only an approved non-compliance in a world where default is almost impossible to avoid...
Rules of Prudence will be challenged deeply by the fangs of reality... In next 6 quarters

*_FIAKS Maven 2019 & 2020 : Start-up Founder says_*

While those people who invested in home loans in costly areas might be among those who are a bit more affected than those who are yet to invest, as with increasing share of remote working, they might choose options at their home place.

While govt tried it's bit, even though not the best set of moves, as they tried to augment supply a bit, while measures to increase demand are still required in large.

Unlike corporate loans, most of the retail loans will be paid back, even though they might be shown as NPA, after the moratorium period, since loans are given at 80% of the property value, and sooner demand picks up, supply serves and people get stability in their jobs, so NPAs with Retail loans vanish for the most part and with most number of banks.

Not only home loans, the personal loans of individuals and term loans of businesses, all gets paid back, as demand increases, as in current connected world and world with credit scores, anybody who think to get loan for a future aspiration, will do everything possible to pay back, and more than loans, it's their savings/investment and their future.

Banks to support their customers, by adjusting interest rates in a reasonably way, while govt to focus on Creating Perpetual Demand for all industries, and stability in the region, w.r.t. geo political scenarios.

7/17/20, 17:48 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 4*

The bank with the least loan-loss provision operates under Charter #1, which is the first national Bank charter issued in the United States.
7/17/20, 18:08 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 84*

Loan-loss provisions among major banks ( *in million U. S. dollars*) in First Quarter, 2020

*1.* JPMorgan Chase (8, 285 million U.S. dollars) 

*2.* Citigroup (7, 001 million U. S. dollars) 

*3.* Bank of America (4, 761 million U. S. dollars) 

*4.* Wells Fargo (4, 005 million U. S. dollars) 


 JPMorgan Chase reportedly has the highest amount of cash available to overcome the cost of loan defaults, with a predicted $8.4 billion set aside for the second quarter. Close behind is Citigroup with an estimated $6.7 billion, while all other banks are also greatly increasing their upward trend for the year. Overall, combined Q2 earnings from these four banks are _predicted_ to be the lowest since the Great Recession. Experts are expecting continued losses for the massive companies even if COVID-19 cases start to fall and are under control by the third or fourth quarter of 2020

One of the major road blocks for the progression of cooperative bankers is  ‚Äú *ENGLISH*‚Äù.  Thought leadership should *NOT* be  associated with a particular language.

Please watch the complete video that I am sharing. It will be an eye opener to many. 

Kindly note customers that cooperative banks serve do not converse in English. It‚Äôs unfortunate that many global events miss our participation and cooperative bankers are not given the importance that they deserve. Even *regulatory authorities* don‚Äôt treat us well. Problems that we face exist in every sector today including fintech (eg -wirecard, Yes bank). 

I see FIAKS beautifully bridging the knowledge divide and updating all the cooperative CEOs here and trying to bring us at par. Announcement of KYC/AML/compliance session today is another good initiative. 

Please include *NPCI product training sessions* as well. With you guys our staff will raise concerns freely and can ask fundamental questions which FIAKS calls as *FAB Query* üòÉ.  Even if 2 or 3 people understand these products in my bank correctly then digital literacy will have a cascading effect. All the best and continue doing a good job

7/20/20, 11:10 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Are Banks Designed To Work From Home?*

This pandemic has put everyone on work from home mode and to surprise many companies are considering it to be the future of work. It seems like a new reality. Well, on the contrary, every company cannot consider work from home to be the future reality. Are banks designed for remote working? Are they not facing challenges in giving connectivity to vendors to operate remotely?

Most organizations have given laptops/desktops at home but have missed out on security. Banks are vulnerable to hacks and data theft as web-based access is enabled to the checker. Also, most of the banks are not completely digitally oriented yet, and thus for such banks running clearing and payment systems is a challenge and hindrance for work from home.

7/20/20, 12:15 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS Financial Report Aggregation (FFRA) 143_

*CITI GROUP*: _Second Quarter 2020 (Apr-May-June)Results_

*Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the second quarter 2020 of $1.3 billion, or $0.50 per diluted share, on revenues of $19.8 billion. This compared to net income of $4.8 billion, or $1.95 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.8 billion for the second quarter 2019.*

‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup revenues of $19.8 billion in the second quarter 2020 increased 5%, primarily reflecting the higher revenues in Fixed Income Markets and Investment Banking, partially offset by the lower revenues in GCB.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup operating expenses of $10.4 billion in the second quarter 2020 decreased 1%, as efficiency savings and lower marketing and other discretionary spend more than offset higher compensation expense, investments and COVID-19 related expenses.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup cost of credit of $7.9 billion in the second quarter 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in the prior-year period, reflecting the ACL builds related to the deterioration in Citi‚Äôs macroeconomic outlook since the end of the first quarter, the corporate loan downgrades and the qualitative management adjustment.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup net income of $1.3 billion in the second quarter 2020 declined 73%, driven by the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate. Citigroup‚Äôs effective tax rate was 9% in the current quarter compared to 22% in the second quarter 2019, reflecting a higher relative impact from tax advantaged investments and other tax benefit items this quarter given the lower level of pre-tax income.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup‚Äôs allowance for credit losses on loans was $26.4 billion at quarter end, or 3.89% of total loans, compared to $12.5 billion, or 1.82% of total loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual assets grew 58% from the prior-year period to $5.9 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans declined 7% to $1.8 billion, while corporate non-accrual loans of $4.0 billion increased from $1.7 billion in the prior year period.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup‚Äôs end-of-period loans were $685 billion as of quarter end, largely unchanged from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation6, end-of-period loans grew 1%, driven by 5% growth in ICG, partially offset by lower loans in GCB and the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCitigroup‚Äôs end-of-period deposits were $1.2 trillion as of quarter end, an increase of 18% from the prior-year period. In constant dollars, Citigroup‚Äôs end-of-period deposits increased 20%, driven by 15% growth in GCB and 22% growth in ICG.
Citigroup‚Äôs book value per share of $83.41 and tangible book value per share of $71.15 each increased 5% versus the prior-year period, driven by a reduction in common shares outstanding. At quarter end, Citigroup‚Äôs CET1 Capital ratio was 11.5%, up from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting a decline in risk-weighted assets. Citigroup‚Äôs SLR for the second quarter 2020 was 6.7%, an increase from the prior quarter. During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of $1.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends.

7/21/20, 11:09 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Promoting Startups: Isn‚Äôt This A Role Of Bank Too?*

It is very difficult for a start-up to get a loan from a commercial bank or lender. To them, they are in fact the riskiest loans of any that a bank or lender might encounter. So understandably they are nervous about startup loans. Because startups don‚Äôt have business credit of their own, the bank has to look at the credit of the people who own the business. Funding from the bank would involve the usual process of sharing the business plan and the valuation details, along with the project report, based on which the loan is sanctioned. This is exactly the mindset that needs to be drastically changed. This mindset literally kills and discourages many startups to even start it out.

<200>  *FIAKS community Debates Tonight* 

FIAKS questions the use of the connector that is used for doing biometric authentication while issuing SIM card  or while opening the bank account. 

Watch the blue colour connector in the pic. If you walk into any electronic outlet then  several such connectors with STORAGE capacity are available. 

The KYC official with an intent to fraud can easily store customer  details in this blue device.  *Isn‚Äôt this risky ??*

*Question 1* Why are cant we eliminate these blue colour connecting devices 

*Question 2* How can telco or bank  say that this device can‚Äôt store customer details? What safe guards are put to derisk ?

7/21/20, 20:36 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Expert on  Blue color connectors used says* 

Biometric service is secured through what we call "RD Service" and associated software in PC or Mobile. RD stands for Registered Devices. This software is in the app or in PoS/PC. The USB to USB-C or USB to MicroUSB connector like this cannot steal any biometric info due to RD Services and associated software. Due to mobiles having USB-C/MicroUSB and PCs having normal USB, Biometric manufacturers cannot have so many variants of USB as customer may use the same Biometric with mobile and/or PC which will have different type of USB terminations. This typically does not compromise any security.

*Question*  Registered Devices?  -   Only mobile and scan device is registered here. *Dont you think this blue colour device should also be registered*

Blue colour device is *breaking* the secure point to point (ie mobile handset to biometric scan device) connectivity. This exposes a risk of data theft and security? Isn‚Äôt it ?

Tried BOB insta click saving account opening - but once I gave pan number, it rejected showing pan number  name mismatch with the name entered in the form..it showed error and all entered data vanishedüòÇ. However overall screen experience (UI/UX) is good.

*FIAKS award winner on PAN AADHAR MATCHING says* 
Pan AADHAR name matching is an interesting challenge.
Indian names with surname combinations can pose a serious challenge when comparing two id docs. 
Many banks follow different practices. For ease of customer journey it is better that we prevent abusive practices in the beginning by using multiple name matching algorithms in iterative mode. 
If one does not match, follow up with another till there is a reasonable level of confidence to believe there is no fraud. Depending upon each bank‚Äôs risk appetite you could set up a manual eyeballing for exceptions after the account is opened and kept In a frozen status. Once the 4 eye principle is met, the freeze could be lifted. 
That would be a balanced approach

The number, although *not 100%* is solid enough to convince you that *privacy issues are not a risk worth running*
7/24/20, 17:03 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 2*

Of the entities that get breached, machinaries of states have the worst scores.
7/24/20, 17:17 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: 1. 80     2. 600% (sounds very strange, but that's what the number seems to be) and 3) Education and Government

The numbers indicate a *direct relationship* between poor privacy practices and data breaches.
7/24/20, 18:12 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 85*

_The answers to this week's quest are:_

*1.* Companies with the worst privacy practices are *80%* more likely to suffer a data breach 

*2.* Companies in the lowest quartile of privacy scores lost *600%* more records than companies with better privacy scores.

*3.* *Government & Educational websites* are 15x more likely to experience a breach than commercial sites


These are some of the key findings of a report realeased by Osano - analyzing the relationship between a company‚Äôs privacy practices and their likelihood of experiencing a data breach. 

Some of the other important facts established in this report are mentioned below >>

The correlations between data breaches and Osano Privacy Scores stem from many causes including willful ignorance, oversight of privacy best practices that increase risk exposure, and company culture around responsible data stewardship. 

According to the Internal Auditors Research Foundation, *third parties were responsible for 2 out of every 3 data breaches.* A tightly linked finding was that the worst privacy actors are the least likely to be able to retrospectively identify the root cause of a breach.

Poor privacy practices translate beyond mere financial market setbacks - *they play with the confidence of the shareholders and consumers.* As Osano Co-Founder and CEO, Arlo Gilbert noted, _‚ÄúThere is a perception that privacy issues are akin to a speeding ticket -- a risk worth running. Companies that don‚Äôt change their perception are facing higher odds of experiencing a data breach and losing the trust they‚Äôve built with their customers.‚Äù_

7/28/20, 08:58 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: An interesting post from FB :
Aditya Puri, the outgoing Managing Director of India's most valuable bank sold 95% of his ESOP equity in the open market yesterday valuing at about Rs. 850 crore. Earlier this year in February he had sold another lot for a total value of Rs. 150 plus crore.

Besides these two block sales, the man has been selling his own bank stocks routinely of late - December 2016 he sold Rs. 49 crore worth of shares, December 2017 he sold about Rs. 19 crore worth of shares, June 2018 he sold about Rs. 37 crore worth of shares, and in August 2019 he sold about Rs. 61 crore worth of his shares. In total, he has sold more than 95% of his equity ownership for a value in excess of Rs. 1,150 crore in his own bank that he has been steering for more than a quarter of a century. He was at the helm of the bank since September 1994, 26 long years.

He is due to retire in three month's time.

He is a living legend in the banking fraternity. He was the highest-paid bank executive in the country. He built the bank from an Rs. 700 crore market capitalization in 1995 when he got the bank listed to a staggering Rs. 5,95,000 crore translating to about 30% compounded annual growth rate every year for 25 years on the trot. I don't recollect any other banker having created that kind of wealth for his shareholders. Simply put, if you had Rs. 1000 worth of shares in his bank in 1995, it would have grown by 850 times in 25 years to give you back Rs. 8,50,000 - you can keep finding the multiples from thereon.

He had everything in him in loads and tons that are required of a successful banker - command on language, brilliant in numbers, articulate in thought, insightful in processes, a visionary knack in business, education just right enough to disrobe any balance sheet, a baritone husky voice. He delivered more than his brief.

Come 2014, with the ascendancy of fascists to power, the man either lost the plot or was just clever enough to side with the despot ruler. He went on record to hail demonetization as one of the biggest reforms measure in modern India and peddled outright blatant lies to an audience of ignoramuses and bhakts who had no clue what the fcuk he was speaking but kept applauding. In that panel, we had India's best know twittering industrialist Anand Mahindra too, who either did not understand what the man was speaking or chose not to question his numbers.

Cutting the story short, questions that blow my mind behind his selling his stake in the bank baffles me. Why would a man of his wealth need to liquidate (almost) all his wealth?

=> Is he privy to some information that most of us do not know?

=> Is he not confident of the next man taking charge from him which is still under RBI's consideration for approval?

=> Has he understated the NPL assets (under 1%) in the bank under his stewardship all there years where according to RBI bank NPLs are going to average around 12.5% in India?

=> Does he fear the government forcing HDFC Bank to buy a PSU bank with a large untenable portfolio of NPLs?

=> Is he joining a competitor in an executive capacity and therefore knows in doing that HDFC Bank valuation is surely going to take a beating?

=> Or simply does the man have no more confidence in India's growth story under Modi's majoritarian leadership? If that be, what a hypocrite he emerged to be!

Just the other day, another corporate honcho and a co-founder of Infosys, S D Shibulal, had offloaded Rs. 786 crore worth of shares in his own company. Why are these captains of the Indian industry rushing to sell their shares in companies that they have cradled and grown?

7/28/20, 10:22 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Though the post starts with Mr.Puri selling his holdings which he has the right to do as long as he is following the rules & the laws; it conveniently flows into Demon and how he & Mr.Mahindra parotted to be on the side of the Govt.

7/28/20, 10:26 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS Bespoke:_ *Do We Need Regulation On Sale Of Stocks By Individuals Who Are Perceived Larger Than Their Associated Institutions?*

Sale of stock should be allowed which is definitely normal, but alongside it creates a doubt in the minds of common investors as to why the official is selling the stock when the official has been invested or associated with the organization throughout like for instance, Uday Kotak of Kotak Bank. Also, there is a need to implement a cap as to how much stock can be sold. The regulator needs to think through this to bring a way out.

7/28/20, 10:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Infact, if you had to speculate from a neutral stand point, I would say Post-covid economic climate is a more likely uncertainty to the economy which would worry someone like Puri, than the political future.

A lot of Central London apartments were buy-to-lets, and a large portion were on Airbnb. So, its been a major bomb. Once moratorium ends next month, owners wont be able to pay mortgage coz of low rentals. The effects of which you will start feeling only by October or so, I guess.

India‚Äôs Banks Are Racing to Lend Against a $1.5 Trillion Hoard of Gold

The World Gold Council estimates that Indian households are sitting on a $1.5 trillion hoard of gold, the biggest of its kind, largely made up of jewelry, which families often inherit or are gifted at weddings. Gold is worn at special occasions and can contribute to a substantial portion of the marriage dowries of women. It also doubles up as an insurance policy and retirement plan in a nation lacking robust social welfare systems.

Other income of ¬£2.5 billion, impacted by slowdown across key markets in the first half

*No.1*
IcelandüáÆüá∏ (0.877)

*No.2*
Norwayüá≥üá¥ (0.842)

*No.3*

8. Spainüá™üá∏ (0.795)
9. Rwandaüá∑üáº (0.791)
10. Germanyüá©üá™ (0.787)

This data is sourced from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index 2020 Rankings.

The index benchmarks national gender gaps on *economic, education, health and political criteria* and provides country rankings that allow for effective comparisons across regions and income groups.In 2020, the Global Gender Gap score (based on the population-weighted average) stands at 68.6%. This means that, on average, the gap is narrower, and the *remaining gap to be closed is 31.4%*

All the top five countries have closed at least 80% of their gaps, and the best performer (Iceland) has closed 82% of its 
gap so far.

On the other end of the spectrum, conflict-ridden, developing countries like Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and Yemen have starkingly low scores.

The overall gender gap performance is a synthesis of performances across the four dimensions composing the index‚Äîthe Economic Participation, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival and Political Empowerment subindexes. As such it masks significant differences in gender gaps across dimensions. 

Overall, this year‚Äôs positive result has been driven mainly by a progress on the Political Empowerment subindex, as well as by marginal improvements on the Health and Survival and Educational Attainment subindexes. Conversely, the progress towards gender parity in terms of Economic Participation and Opportunity registers a retraction.

To see the ranks of all 153 countries, refer to *Page 9* of the following PDF.

 When Google Pay is allowed in India then why WhatsApp entry was restricted? Was this partnership only option left with Whatsapp to make an entry into India into payments space?
Facebook was trying to launch WhatsApp Pay and in order to launch that, it struggled with regulation for three years because of privacy issues and blocking by high access of another payment company. Hence, Facebook made a deal with the big daddy of Indian companies.

Another point raised up was ‚Äòwhen Chinese bank buys 1% in HDFC, it‚Äôs China taking over the Indian economy. But when Facebook buys 9% in Jio, it‚Äôs boosting the Indian economy.‚Äô

Will INR refrain from ugly August? As we enter into the August seasonality, in the hindsight the performance of INR has always been challenged. 

Going by the history from 2005, INR has been underperformer in August month for 13 years out of last 15 years , where on an average INR has depreciated by 1.70%(excluding 2013).

In last couple of weeks weaker $ across major currencies has not helped INR to gain much (majorly RBI acting as defender) so a correction in $ along with risk off scenario in equity market can rewrite the August history for Rupee.In terms of levels 74.70 will act as first line of support followed by 74.45.

Today if we see, we are all acquainted with every global brand along with the entrepreneur‚Äôs name. But do even know the names of our own Indian entrepreneurs who have made it big in the industry. Isn‚Äôt this sad?

This support will come by taking the first step to acknowledge these local entrepreneurs and talking about them, talking about their business, talking about their success, spreading the word and the rest will fall in place eventually. However, restrictive practices e.g. no global tenders will hide inefficiencies and incentives to improve quality. Free markets should not be disturbed as much as possible.

8/6/20, 01:08 - Vikas Business Phone: *Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has returned the NBFC applications of several Start-ups*

_*Start-ups impacted*_:

‚ñ™Ô∏è include Sequoia-backed *BharatPe*, 
‚ñ™Ô∏èGoogle Capital-backed *CarDekho*, and 
‚ñ™Ô∏èdigital banking startup *Jupiter*, backed by Sequoia and Matrix Partners, 

*_RBI Reason_*

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tighter scrutiny of Chinese capital coming into local startups via tax havens like Mauritius where most venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) funds are registered.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Money coming from funds registered in Mauritius, which is on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list, is being seen as capital from a jurisdiction with weaker norms to counter money laundering. This has resulted in the RBI returning these applications, the sources added.

3Ô∏è‚É£ India has been making multiple moves to boycott Chinese influence in the Indian economy since the Ladakh border conflict that started in May. According to sources aware of the regulator‚Äôs thinking, the scrutiny of these applications has also increased owing to the involvement of limited partners, or LPs ‚Äî who invest in VC funds ‚Äî *with origins in China*.

8/6/20, 08:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Makes sense - Future IPL + Video = High data consumption + paid video subscriber = all the stuff is high usage / high LTV / high txn size.

I would also guess they struck some kind of deal with Hotstar or Hotstar could have also struck a deal with them. Won‚Äôt be surprised.

But makes sense both ways.

8/6/20, 09:34 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: High data consumption doesnt make sense because data is free - whether its high or low. 
Also reality is JIO has majority of consumers with extremely average and fixed ARPU (most use a uearly plan or a fixed monthly recharge in prepaid) and thus High LTV consumers in its portfolio are not high

The reasons are more internal. Jio powers content on Jio Cinema etc through partnership with Hotstar. As a part of the deal cross promote hotstar. 

They are ‚Äúfrenemies‚Äù till Jio starts producing all its content independently or licensing from other sources.
8/6/20, 09:43 - +91 90233 89243: thinking on same lines
8/6/20, 09:43 - +91 90233 89243: Or may be their jiofiber plans have replacing jiocinema with jiohotstar?
8/6/20, 09:45 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Not sure. But i heard that hotstar also was trying to reach all broadband providers for free offers / pay to acquire models
8/6/20, 09:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is a given no?
8/6/20, 09:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I mean the fact is today no one really has above average arpu minus postpaid connections / prepaid delta is very low, but the tendency is most people only do Hotstar for sports and there is therefore a seasonal element on this.
8/6/20, 09:50 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Of course Jio will compete on all fronts anyway, so that‚Äôs just another good reason
8/6/20, 09:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think Netflix also piloted something similar, at least down south, not sure if it‚Äôs continuing amidst Covid
8/6/20, 09:53 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Agree. Telcos now want lower consumption as revenues are fixed. Plus capacity in most places is becoming an issue.
8/6/20, 09:56 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: As per Disney quarterly report released yesterday Hotstar+Disney has 9mn paying customers. Vast majority are on 399 pa Rs 35 pm plan. Prime Video and to some extent Netflix has tied up with telcos and they have got significant subscribers. Its win win. Logically Hotstar & VIL makes a strategic partnership and rest 2 telcos have a good OTT play. VIL play in OTT is at best pathetic - sad to say this.
8/6/20, 09:59 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Netflix has an arrangement with VIL. And VIL offers Netflix as a part of the Vodafone Red X plan. That's a part of the recent 'premium plan' controversy
8/6/20, 10:04 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Yup, the Red + (premium plans) will have less users. Also good probability that the Red X plan user is already a Netflix user. Since the retail price is 499 pm Netflix/VIL cannot offer at lower plans. But as regards to Prime Video since retail price is 129 pm they can braodbase to even Red plan of 499 pm. Makes sense. The 399 pa plan of Hotstar was an ideal plan to bundle for VIL even with the say 399 prepaid pans.
8/6/20, 10:09 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Absolutely agree
8/6/20, 10:14 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Vodafone had started looking at 3rd party OTT many years back - I don‚Äôt know what stalled them back then / or why it didn‚Äôt succeed. May be you can throw the light.
8/6/20, 10:22 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: I left Vodafone 6 years back. Many I knew also left in the last few years. No Idea what VIL is upto nowadays. They still have significant nos of loyal postpaid users 'family silverware' as one CEO use to put it. They have to retain them at any cost and bundling good OTT service is a good ploy especially when the OTT service that you have is almost non existence. Hotstar, Prime & Netflix is a good strategy to bundle as most postpaid users will be using these services. Bit like how banks tie up with discounts for shopping.
8/6/20, 10:35 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Its astonishing how far Vodafone has fallen behind. As a vendor providing bits and pieces to Orange/Hutch/Vodafone for many years, they were always highly regarded and placed on a pedestal for their thinking and execution. The change of hands and the subsequent tax claims are probably the time when the decline began, in hindsight
8/6/20, 11:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I think the decline began even earlier when they couldn‚Äôt position either on volume end or margin end at some point, trying to take the middle road between Airtel and Idea, which ultimately was the beginning of the end for Vodafone in India - Also Vodafone has always been too corporatised unlike its counter-parts, both a pro and a con.

The entire digitalisation and start-up story is ONLY targeted towards same *100 million population* that has 90%  of India‚Äôs disposable income. _What about rest 1100 million people?_ *Really sad!*

Urgent need for regulators/NPCI work on projects that use data & tech to bring  these 1100 million people who do not have history of work, produce or income. India digitalisation projects need to  focus on segment who‚Äôs

8/8/20, 12:41 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on *IMPORTANCE  OF COOPERATIVE BANK* to reach next 1100 million people in India_üáÆüá≥ 

*View of Top Leader who was part of team that setup the ICICI bank 1994 and was CEO of one of the ICICI group companies*

Along with Co-operative Banks, even RRBs can play a role. Unfortunately, their model has not been successful as we can see from their ability to connect the communities in the manner that Nandan is talking about. This will need a different kind of institutional intervention which will have to work as a non profit/low margin business........maybe a commercial for profit venture with support from the likes of Gates/Dell foundation etc

*View Start-up Founder who is FIAKS Maven 2019&2010*

Village centric Economy has a lot of potential and while factory approach made us embrace certain aspects, irrespective of local source availability, we need to embrace our age old idea of Self Sufficiency w.r.t. Village Economy, that makes things work in a mutually interdependent way and within the Village.

Co-operative Banks surely have a role, as they focus on limited target area, where they can holistically serve their userbase.

Solutions that uses
a) Local Language along with English and other regionally speaking languages
b) address working solutions in digital way

if cooperative banks are supported with technology and simplified/transparent processes, they being local with employees mostly from the region, can gain the trust of their customers while serving them with maximum recurrence and through a long term relationship that builds in the process.

Agriculture is a core demand creating area and when that is made surely profitable, Village Economy thrives like 3 flowers & 6 fruits 365 days

8/8/20, 23:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
8/8/20, 23:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: More interesting because people who initially wanted Zero MDR might not want it any more, however these folks made everyone look at the crystal ball of the future and everyone now strategically understands that Day Zero MDR almost looks inevitable across payment interfaces because of myriad of reasons.
8/8/20, 23:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Previously, I had spoken about a decentralised permissioned card scheme on the blockchain.. 

Now, would be a good time for something like that..
8/8/20, 23:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: People would have an opinion if they understood what it does or does not
8/8/20, 23:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Where so called ‚Äúdirect members‚Äù (the large issuers & acquirers) will be the full nodes
8/8/20, 23:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India is not going to adopt anything on blockchain majorly unless it has a test case showing its benefits in a large B2B2C system elsewhere in the world

8/8/20, 23:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: All other full nodes on backup list
8/8/20, 23:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This will allow visa-like capabilities in terms of load handling
8/8/20, 23:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: But still decentralised & democratic
8/9/20, 00:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Regulation wise.. it could be bit tricky because typically it should be a no ownership model, which means RBI may not be happy with it.. since they probably will license a company & not a blockchain
8/9/20, 00:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This wont really have a currency as such.. just a decentralised way to clear card payments instantly.. in any currency.. without the usual multi-party approval model..

8/9/20, 03:47 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: A nice commentary on what the future may hold. A bit futuristic though. 

It‚Äôs quite possible that the future workplace will increase the divide between the companies who can afford to implement wfh as the new normal and adapt their work places to be more safe. The vast majority of small and mid sized businesses will not have the financial strength to incur higher costs and the divide will become even bigger. 

So while pundits predict the future, I wonder how inclusive and equitable such changes will be.
8/9/20, 05:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is an almost foregone conclusion.
Not much can be done about it.
Good article though.
8/9/20, 10:43 - +1 (916) 837-0472: Sir - NABARD and the CO-operative banks were working just fine including APMC sales - then the commission agents started dragging in the politicians and mega Companies to bid for entire lots at throw away prices. Basically political interference messed up the village economy model
8/9/20, 10:44 - +1 (916) 837-0472: And the CO-operatives and RRBs were being forced to use CBS from one of 3 vendors - the model proved too costly. Startup‚Äôs that tried to solve for low cost banking systems were stamped out one by one
8/9/20, 10:50 - +1 (916) 837-0472: It is nothing new that Nandan has said - this has been clearly document led in the Vaidyanathan committee report

8/9/20, 14:43 - Vikas Business Phone: *Community member says CAN YOU BELIEVE CHINA DATA*
_Here is the correct update_ 

Mainland China's exports to India since January 2020 have fallen by 24.7 per cent year-on-year to $32.28 billion, customs data from the Chinese government has shown. This comes at a time when the call to boycott Chinese products has amplified sharply in India since May after the India-China border face-off in Galwan.

China's imports from India have also gone up 6.7 per cent since January this year to $11.09 billion. Consequently, total trade with India has registered a slightly lower 18.6 per cent drop since the beginning of 2020 to at $43.47 billion. However, in July China's exports saw a slight jump to $5.6 billion, up from $4.79 billion in June, 2020.

VISA announced its partnership to launch payments on WhatsApp. Well, well aren‚Äôt these competing brands in the payments space? WhatsApp can easily enable P2P and P2M payments without Visa or Mastercard through bank partnerships. Isn‚Äôt this partnership like Bank of America selling Wells Fargo saving accounts in its branches?

There is probably a whole generation of Visa executives who have been taught how Kodak‚Äôs competition was not Canon/Nikon but Nokia or that of the airlines was Cisco/Video conferencing. And hence Visa looks at WhatsApp and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be Kodak‚Äù and sidles up for a collaboration! Also, but natural the product which is the fastest to enter the market and has a very clean user experience wins. People are used to WhatsApp and they will add referrals too which will help in faster adaptability.

8/11/20, 16:26 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member shared story on Apple at $2 Trillion* 

As Apple flirts with the $2 Trillion market cap, let‚Äôs look at who made the largest contribution to hitting that landmark. Was it Steve Jobs? Tim Cook? Jonathan Ive?

There is 1 person who played a big role in Apple‚Äôs $2 Trillion mile stone. And it‚Äôs not any of the usual suspects.

That man is *Luca Maestri*, current CFO of Apple. He joined Apple in 2013, and took over as CFO from 2014. And scripted probably the greatest investment story in the history of humanity.

Luca Maestri followed a very simple strategy - *buy back Apple shares*. On and on. And the results are staggering, beyond you can imagine.

_Apple has purchased 2.5 Billion shares, paying $450 Billion. And the shares he has purchased, would be today worth $1.125 Trillion. That means the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù from the share buyback, is $675 Billion!!_

Let‚Äôs see that $675 Billion in another way. It is more than all the profits Apple has ever made, in its entire history, from 1976 till date!!

One of the things people say about GM, is that it is a big pension fund, with a car company attached.

_Luca Maestri is making Apple into the best investment fund on the planet, with the best computer, phone, wearables, and services business attached to it_

Should all CFOs start buying back its share ???
8/11/20, 16:40 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community leader who is serial entrepreneur on LUCA MAESTRI say*

This is called CFO...not what we typically employ in India.

8/11/20, 22:14 - NSDL Aneesh khanna NnR: Buy back is a common approach to reward promoters, increase share price and nothing unique. But for that the business has to be generating a lot of excess cash.
8/11/20, 22:15 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on BUY BACK of üçé on LUCA MAESTRI*

This is an incomplete example. To buy back shares, raise dividend consistently; are generally second and third capital allocation priorities. For companies like APPL, you need to invest in products and user experience first. 

Else you can look at IBM -  probably one of best examples of major buybacks and raising dividend still they are no where in the space they play. They lost the game in cloud computing as they are way behind Amazon MSFT and goog. More importantly not growing as fast. 

You always need strong balance sheet, ability to survive with cash as a swimming pool and a robust product line before even thinking of buybacks.
8/12/20, 08:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Was reading some Covid-19 articles about T-cells memory helping to fight all kinds of viruses etc. long story short, ended up calculating a few figures on my mobile while looking at trends for Indian cities.

- All major Indian cities seem to be at their somewhere between 45-60 day range and then tapering off between 90 to 120 days
- The best way to judge the peak is calculating 1% of total population for a city at 2020 numbers and then seeing in which 30 day period did they get affected, that period would be the peak.
- Almost all major Indian cites with big populations have peaked, Bangalore being the latest, and all of Bangalore‚Äôs peak will be today minus 7 to next 7-10 days, and will then inevitably taper off.
- Cities will taper off to a stable 500 number between 90-120, 250 beyond that and will stay that way pretty much not tapering down much beyond that.
- All this assumes similar or growing number is testing + stable or decreasing test positivity rate.
- Big cities = Assumed or close to 1 Cr population
- Smaller cities will peak slower but also taper slower as a %age
- One should ideally account for net migration in the same time period
- Tier II / Tier III / Tier N India will face difficulties starting end of this month / beginning of next month, whoever hasn‚Äôt reached the 1% population figure, however because of density this number might vary between 0.75 to 1.25% for a city for the peak period of 30 days.
- Total population affected will be 7.5% in best case, 10% in worst case, within a major Indian city. 

The reason I shared this here is because I think businesses will start getting back up after the 120-150 day period from the time a city did 0.00025% of positive cases / population at the beginning, peaking at 0.003% of daily cases / population, tapering off to the same 0.00025% number over the next 4-5 months.

What is the curve following?
Some sort of a half-life, at least while tapering, so also a mirror while growing. Retrospectively, all this sounds pretty obvious because it will form a bell-curve going through the population, which is what this is - The key however is the ~1% population positivity in a 30 day period - That is how we will get to know any peak therefore take any personal or professional calls that we might need to take.

If I get the time today, which I most probably won‚Äôt, will dive deeper on an actual laptop, and see how far all this holds true for real, and will update. Hope this helps someone in someway in some planning via a (over)simplified heuristics - if a city hasn‚Äôt done ~1% Covid-19 spread within a given 30 day period, it hasn‚Äôt peaked.

8/12/20, 11:07 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *Ban On Chinese Apps: How?*

Are there previous instances of a Government asking Google or Apple to remove apps and they have complied? China has of course banned some social media apps but it is that at AppStore level or network level.

Well, the law of the land prevails. If the authorities of the local law ask Apple and Google, with valid reasoning and proofs the stores would comply. There have been past precedents. The other point is that even if the App stores have the app, the government can do port/IP blocks to make the apps pretty unusable from a content perspective at least. Every app can define the territories where it wants to be visible/downloaded. Apps often localize the listings for territories as well. At any time one can reduce or expand this list

*View 11* _COO MNC_

He will get exposed only if he is hiding something. The reason why he is managing digital payments is because he understands customers and payments due to his rich experience. The juniors in his team who understand the tech jargon do not understand banking and the key skill here is banking. Any vendor can provide the technical solutions but only an experienced banker can apply them to solve a problem. So, he should not pretend that he understands this jargon and ask for clarification whenever needed.
That said, he needs to over the next few months familiarise himself with the digital world and all that it can do and enable. This will make him a better leader and also help his earn the respect of his team and vendors.

*View 14* CEO PSU 

Trust in your experience and allow a few days you will understand..in these few days work harder to learn the words and jargons. Also allow the millennials to help you decide. Think what you did on the first day as branch manager. You can do it. More than anything you have a bankers instinct. It is a great strength

8/13/20, 20:21 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: A true leader hires a talented and diversified team. Capabilities that can be complimented. 
1. Hire people who know more than you. 
2. Empower them and you will learn from them. 
3. Vendors and partners can deal with your team
The leader may not know new technology but people go to them for their vision, their thought, decision making

You guys were typing something .. please freely post ur views
8/13/20, 20:54 - +1 (916) 837-0472: Sir - your biggest strength is knowing your customers needs and wants and creating solves for that via experiences that customers love. Implementing that via technology is the how. Focus on the why and what. Happy to volunteer myself for pro bono 1-1 sessions and would like to tag @918527765656 @14379904466 among many others in our group who can help. I personally love working with people smarter than myself and challenge them to find solves that align with regulation and compliance but with fresh perspective. I think sir is in a position of strength and just needs to adjust his position and perspective. Humble thanks üôè
8/13/20, 21:09 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Fascinating question!
Given that this person was recently promoted to a role in the Digital Initiative department, I imagine that someone believes in their capability to pick up the needed skills. That should give pause to the self-doubt and let them focus on learning.

The fact that this question has been asked shows a fair amount of self-awareness - which is a rare commodity in general and rarer in people with that kind of experience. Bodes well for doing something about the problem faced.

The process of moving ahead should be as many others have suggested. Some humility, confidence that the real knowledge needed is that of banking and willingness to learn from juniors should be good enough! It may be easy to find someone from the vendor community who can help and they are usually the most knowledgeable - though if not handled well it can be double edged.

8/13/20, 21:15 - +91 90233 89243: Presuming the guy is not the CTO, else the question seems irrelevant. For other CXO, knowing ( I mean literally juat knowing) these new tehch jargoans are not that difficult and should learn fundamentals, so that they dont face such issues.
8/13/20, 21:16 - +91 90233 89243: *tech jargons
8/13/20, 21:17 - Vikas Business Phone: Why not CTO 

Ajay Jaggia was made CTO of HDFC bank by Aditya Puri
8/13/20, 21:18 - +91 90233 89243: A Tech Officer not knowing tech jargons and facing difficulties seems bit strange , isnt it?
8/13/20, 21:20 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Btw on a lighter note, @19168370472 was an exception to this. 
Along With his age, his knowledge and interests in the new and upcoming grew better and better. 

And on a more serious note, despite age competition or new generation, if there is humility and willingness to learn, its abs doable.
8/13/20, 21:27 - +1 (916) 837-0472: üëç - we always learn
8/13/20, 21:28 - +91 90233 89243: And age is just a numberüòä
8/13/20, 21:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Wanted to point out another thing - Youngsters love older people who clearly say they don‚Äôt know and want to learn something. Youngsters will respect you more if you are upfront about it and add perspectives rather than hide it. Good youngsters have so much to learn from experience of older leaders that they will never mostly think of undermining a leader if he/she is looking to learn.

8/14/20, 18:03 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 88*

The countries with the Highest share of Female Adult Population engaged in Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurial Activity are as follows:

*No.1*
 Chileüá®üá± (32.4%)

*No.2*
U.S.A.üá∫üá∏ (16.6%)

*No.3*
United Arab Emirates (12.6%)


According to a study carried out in 40 countries and territories by the Global Entrepreneurship Research Association, female entrepreneurs are especially common in developing nations like Angola, as well as in developed countries Chile and the U.S. Many developed nations in Europe have very low rates of female entrepreneurs, according to the study.

The researchers distinguish between necessity-driven entrepreneurship, which can be caused by a lack of formal employment opportunities in a country, and innovation-driven entrepreneurialism, which exists in countries with well-developed formal job markets.

While there is a positive correlation between male and female levels of early-stage entrepreneurial activity, and while the majority of countries continue to have male levels of entrepreneurial activity in excess of that of females, in 2019 there are *three GEM-participating economies where the female rate exceeds the male rate*

8/17/20, 10:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As I was saying ^
8/17/20, 10:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÖ
8/17/20, 10:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 30 million? Thats all urban ladder is worth? üßê
8/17/20, 10:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All groups discussing the same thing
8/17/20, 10:12 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: If RIL stays in all verticals, what will be the data security and won‚Äôt be used in cross platform juicing ? Govt is stopping the others from monopolies but indirectly are encouraging monopoly. 
Needs to be cautious.
8/17/20, 10:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indian retail is tough, both online and offline, tread carefully - If model is wrong, nothing will work - Regardless of money raised. Urban ladder has raised $ 100 Mn. Founders are decent as well.
8/17/20, 10:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs a given
8/17/20, 10:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Turns out $115 Mn
8/17/20, 10:27 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: How was Saavn valuation done. We all know. The cash payout was ....  founders and investors of Saavn got .....
8/17/20, 10:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes but no one is saying all this na
8/17/20, 10:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is the problem
8/17/20, 10:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And Saavn would still be a good case, these will be much worse
8/17/20, 10:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Hmmmm
8/17/20, 10:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If funding dries up, most of these fancy startups can be worth nothing, very soon..
8/17/20, 10:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Covid has probably been a reality check for many! üòÖ
8/17/20, 10:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Honestly
8/17/20, 10:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No
8/17/20, 10:36 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: No one can say anything due to fear. And if they want to buy someone they ensure that cos funding dries up. Age old strategy. It was right from NOCIL
8/17/20, 10:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Some of them may be were pushed a little but their models were already known
8/17/20, 10:36 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: SOP hai
8/17/20, 10:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: That works because VC funding has become legal Ponzi!
8/17/20, 10:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Taking money from 1 person, to boost image & future valution, to raise money from next person
8/17/20, 10:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: How exactly is it different from a a Ponzi scam?
8/17/20, 10:40 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: But that‚Äôs how VCs have been working for ages.
8/17/20, 10:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: See you can‚Äôt blame the VCs if the founders don‚Äôt get finance
8/17/20, 10:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: VCs are to blame
8/17/20, 10:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Of course but how are founders doing justice to themselves?
8/17/20, 10:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not sure if thats a justifiable reason for doing it. Haha
8/17/20, 10:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Pressure?

Pressure of no money / survival.
Once u get money, pressure to grow / increase valuation.. focus is rarely on unit economics or profitability..
8/17/20, 10:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I principally think founders are bad at finance in India and this costs them fortunes
8/17/20, 10:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That and market research etc
8/17/20, 10:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: These seem like things to bother with later but they are crucial because if your TAM / SAM is wrong + you sign wrong deals with bad T&Cs, you are pretty much done
8/17/20, 10:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: At that point, its already too late, because you know you wont get your next round unless u do what investors expect.. and its not about anything else..

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/citi-wired-900-million-in-clerical-error-they-wont-hand-cash-back-2280480#publisher=newsstand

A billion dollar clerical error!
8/17/20, 10:57 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: 9 out of 10 startups fail and 1 hits it out of the park. Repeat that statistics 10 times and you will see that pattern will keep on holding. India is no different in that regard, there is no ponzi scheme etc. It's just a new experience for us to see startups that have raised 100M+ start failing. This will become more commonplace in future just like more mature markets.
8/17/20, 10:58 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: How I wish my banker does a similar error and I can refuse to pay the money backüòú
8/17/20, 10:59 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
8/17/20, 10:59 - Vikas Business Phone: You raised Important point here
8/17/20, 11:00 - Vikas Business Phone: Another important point  raised here
8/17/20, 11:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It looks like legal ponzi because of this but it is not
8/17/20, 11:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is the rule of law for VC funding, not going to change much
8/17/20, 11:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: However more prudent foresight of founders in some case definitely would help
8/17/20, 11:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Betting on statistics based on odds like that is gambling.
Not investment. üßê
8/17/20, 11:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Lol
8/17/20, 11:03 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: And it shouldn't. Changing behaviour and innovation at mass scale is expensive. I think every 100 years we will see a new financial instrument of funding innovation.
8/17/20, 11:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is interesting because PE is actually about 100 years old
8/17/20, 11:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Moreover, do these investors invest based on potential profits? Or potential valuation?
8/17/20, 11:04 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: why don't you go and learn that in the market?
8/17/20, 11:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They throw money till it seems to become ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù..
8/17/20, 11:04 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Look alibaba or fb or google profits?
8/17/20, 11:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Valuations at interval = Profit.
They optimise for their profit, not that of the company‚Äôs necessarily and you can‚Äôt blame them for it.
8/17/20, 11:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Every liquidity event is a profit opportunity
8/17/20, 11:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why do we think only IPOs make money?
8/17/20, 11:07 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I wouldnt know specifics, but am fairly certain none of them were even a fraction as hyped up by investors, as many startups now
8/17/20, 11:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Thats a justification that can hold for a ponzi operator too? üòÇ
8/17/20, 11:08 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: They were hyped much more than you can imagine. The multiples that Google and FB received were same level to what Indian startups receive today.
8/17/20, 11:09 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: WhatsApp got bought for 19bn USD at zero revenue

Instagram got bought at 1bn USD at zero revenue

Pls calculate the multiples !
8/17/20, 11:11 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Railtel has huge network
8/17/20, 11:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: For every successul exit like that, there are 100s where VCs threw 3rd party money at projects only due to FOMO
8/17/20, 11:13 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: That's how the business model is
8/17/20, 11:14 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Those third parties have invested their monies in VCs (hopefully) fully knowing that the model is high risk and high mortality
8/17/20, 11:14 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: If you start making 100X in 30% of your investment, why would anyone investment anywhere else
8/17/20, 11:14 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: Invest*
8/17/20, 11:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yeah. If you say so! üòÖ
8/17/20, 11:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is the only reality
8/17/20, 11:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs X% of portfolio in Y instrument for Z geography
8/17/20, 11:15 - Vikas Business Phone: Good point .. Whats app is zero revenue but great product.. 

So many business are running on it including FIAKS ... 

On Whatsapp so many business are making revenue .. its creating jobs for so many people .
8/17/20, 11:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Roulette has better odds.
8/17/20, 11:16 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: It has started happening now, it was bought 5 years back when none of this was happening
8/17/20, 11:17 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: If you think the VC investors are not aware of the risks it's really their money and their problem or gain. They always have ETF as an option to invest üòâ

Unfortunately it's not easy to identify the winners. I guess some of the above were not considered good investment (they might have thought the ones betting on ghese to be speculating?)... Which is why these vehicles serve a purpose. Which is why there are ones who end up being more successful than others in their picks

Not sure if that is how Amazon does it, and certainly, the general delivery companies are not equipped with such facilities yet.

8/17/20, 23:12 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: I would not call it betting on statistics. Every investment is an informed choice and there is an investment committee that evaluates deals. The statistics is an outcome of VC investments inherently being high-risk in nature as they are backing startups that have potential for massive scale.

Over time, the risk appetite of firms keeps changing, and they tend to be guided by the minimum return they are required to give to their LPs. Investments and exits that kick up that average ROI is what sets one firm apart from the other.

So call it what you may, but it is not gambling.

If you walk into any electronic outlet then several such connectors with storage capacity are available. The KYC official with intent to fraud can easily store customer details in this blue device.  *Isn‚Äôt this risky?*

8/19/20, 19:17 - Vikas Business Phone: <209>  *FIAKS community Debates Tonight* 

FIAKS Community thought leader who recently wrote an article in _FIAKS e-Bulletin_ raises a question 

*Can LOCAL FINTECH company ever become GLOBAL?*

To support his argument he says the strongest banks in the world get most of their business from their home country. They have global presence in measured manner and limited global revenue.

The Fintech story seems to be following the same path. *Strongest Fintechs get most of their revenue from the home country*. Neo/Digital banks get most of their revenue from one country.
*Visa and MasterCard* solved that well through great partnership's with Banks across the world. That's a model which seemed to have worked. *Today given Nationalism challenges, even that model is threatened*

_*Will there be any scope for global financial players? What is the successful Model going forward?*_

8/19/20, 19:51 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts who successfully expanded businesses overseas on ‚ÄúCAN LOCAL FINTECH BECOME GLOBAL‚Äù*  says  Anonymously 


Founder led Fintech (not Infosys type companies) will find it difficult to be global organisation. They have baniya approach which may have worked well in home country. However for overseas market expansion I have serious doubts. 

1. founder needs to have very important ingredient called ‚ÄúPatience‚Äù. Gestation period in these markets are too long. 

2. I have worked with Indian, Nepalese and Bangladeshi founders who were settled in US and Singapore. These Fintech founders are *visionary only on power point presentation*. They don‚Äôt want to understand difference between expense and investment. They want to make quick money leaving half baked products /projects. Rarely you will find a fintech founder working for success stories in these global markets. Top of his mind is always Money ! Money!! and only Money!!!

Founder just want to show that they are global company to the world with couple of sign-ups. No serious intent to serve the overseas market.. they looking at it more from valuations perspective and better exit for PE/VC

3. Most founders are looking for partnership with large tech organisation with international presence as they offer partnerships  *FREE*. Results of such partnerships are known. Fintech founders loves anything FREE. 

4. Try raising voice with local Singaporean or Vietnamese. They will quit the job next day. Can you ever imagine staff taking a nap post lunch. It‚Äôs a cultural shock to these founders üòÑ. They are use to treating their employees as slaves with glorified titles.

I would prefer working for European or Brit or Canadian founder as they talk dollars. Indian or Nepalese or Bangladeshi founder will keep calculating in home currency and will always be in state of shocküòÑ.
8/19/20, 20:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is an amazingly wrong understanding and pretty condescending at that.

Please don‚Äôt think everyone you have worked with or listened to are the only people who exist in the universe.

The view is extremely parochial and provincial.
8/19/20, 20:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The fact that founders (without naming anyone in specific) are able to do so much with so little support in India is amazing.

Entrepreneurship in any field in India, at a large set-up level, is very new phenomenon. Look at most of the entrepreneurs who are in any field today - What‚Äôs our average age? Almost half at max 2/3 of the age vs the person saying this. This matters. We have a long way ahead of us to win games we want to win.

Don‚Äôt dismiss first generation early entrepreneurs like this please. It‚Äôs extremely condescending and especially more so when spoken in private and not in public. I can personally vouch that most people in corporates or ages beyond a certain range have no clue to what‚Äôs happening in the startups between of founders between 22 and 35, because most founders will never talk openly about it, so it is at best half knowledge.
8/19/20, 20:24 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
8/19/20, 20:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is a small saying that goes like - ‚ÄúChange happens slowly and then all of a sudden‚Äù. Startups are the easiest way to explain this phenomenon. Please understand that the best bet of currently people over 40 in India is to partner and give wisdom to people between 25 and 35, otherwise nobody will remember you in history. You can already see it happening.
8/19/20, 20:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: FYI, partnerships are pushed more by certain VC funds, more than founders themselves.
8/19/20, 20:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why they do that we all know - But founders understand this and will figure how to manage the relationship as they get more mature, remember India can‚Äôt have 5-10% NPA and 11.25% interest rates, banking will have to open up - It is not about if, it is about when. Government and current banks have no choice here.
8/19/20, 20:28 - Vikas Business Phone: Coming back to question can "local  fintech be global"
8/19/20, 20:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Are local banks global?
8/19/20, 20:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I can ask extremely brutal questions.
8/19/20, 20:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Local banks are not even global beyond BKC in Bombay.
8/19/20, 20:30 - Vikas Business Phone: In the question its said that mojarity of revenues are from local markets
8/19/20, 20:30 - Vikas Business Phone: Even for global banks
8/19/20, 20:30 - Vikas Business Phone: Extactly the question
8/19/20, 20:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is a legal question
8/19/20, 20:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs not a startup question
8/19/20, 20:30 - Vikas Business Phone: Read the question again
8/19/20, 20:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Its for FINTECH
8/19/20, 20:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Founder led fintech will find it difficult to be global, but Infosys like will find it easy, because founder led fintechs are baniya like.
8/19/20, 20:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Patience is not a virtue of startups.
8/19/20, 20:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Anybody saying this has not run a high speed startup at all in the last 3-5 years.
8/19/20, 20:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is applicable globally.
8/19/20, 20:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And thank God founders have their mind on money.
8/19/20, 20:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: My experience has been the reverse, to some extent. Potential investor was very keen to invest, but expected me to move from profitability model to growth model, by boarding merchants on lower margin for sake of showing bigger numbers. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/19/20, 20:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because the complaint is generally in reverse.
8/19/20, 20:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Without sounding ageist, how old is the person asking this question as an age range?
8/19/20, 20:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Evidently, this hype & ‚Äúponzi‚Äù mentality has finally lead to 0-MDR trend in India, which is unheard of anywhere. 

Today, I am fairly certain India is the worst market for Fintech compabies who have any intention to make a profit without burning investor money!
8/19/20, 20:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Just to be clear, 0 MDR was already accepted 4-5 years back.
8/19/20, 20:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We knew this would happen.
8/19/20, 20:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Fintechs also knew, it was just about when - the answer is penetration rate.
8/19/20, 20:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There are pros and cons, it‚Äôs not just a one way problem.
8/19/20, 20:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But 0 MDR is the future of global payments, just wait and watch.
8/19/20, 20:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is a clear global trend for all mass consumed products and services - The trend towards 0 transaction cost.
8/19/20, 20:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The larger trend was already understood.
8/19/20, 20:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And this is not just payments.
8/19/20, 20:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: My experience was prior to that. This is pretty much inline with what I was discussing few days back. Unfortunately, recipients of massive investor funds refuse to acknowledge. üòù
8/19/20, 20:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is food delivery, your cab ride, your social network, your video network, your articles, your video app for your meetings - everything which has large consumer base will go towards 0 transaction costs and get mass distributed.
8/19/20, 20:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: MDR is just an extension of the same thought.
8/19/20, 20:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I dont think so. Regulated & restricted, but not 0. 

0-MDR is pretty much killing an industry. 

In EU, rates are controlled, but you cannot make money from side business due to strict laws like GDPR which wont allow compnies to use data or users to monetise in other ways.
8/19/20, 20:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We are basically asking why are MasterCard and Visa the best answer for today‚Äôs world?

Why should I pay for SBI lunch hours?
8/19/20, 20:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Without explicit permissions
8/19/20, 20:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And each generation will ask this question better than previous ones.
8/19/20, 20:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is why EU is a haven for tech innovation, or is it?
8/19/20, 20:49 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Don't know what yard sticks you keep for any fintech to be called as global, atleast I know pinelabs, mswipe, AGS had already gone into south asian countries and middle east expanding their POS/ ATM businesses..
8/19/20, 20:54 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Difficult to see this happening in next 10 years. Most probably, govt will bring back MDR on rupay/upi as well sometime.
8/19/20, 20:56 - Vikas Business Phone: Discusssion in not on MDR..Can *local fintech become global*
8/19/20, 20:57 - Vikas Business Phone: Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts On can *Local Fintech can be Global*

*Views 28*  Serial entrepreneur 

He says View may seem crudely put.  *But sentiment may not be too way off*. Going global requires a certain vision and mindset...where founder may need to become a  small part of a big thing. As versus continuing to want to be a big part of a small thing. I find people who have worked in large global organisations may reflect some of that hunger and know what it takes. To be truly Global.  Rest often fall in between the stools. Either money or control or both.
8/19/20, 20:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes government will bring back MDR for sure
8/19/20, 20:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But once an idea has come, people will find a way to beat it.
8/19/20, 20:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Who can stop me from paying back the Merchant the MDR in a different format?
8/19/20, 20:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its related. 

Coz Indian vs Global is 
Frugality/Price-war vs Innovation
8/19/20, 20:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sort of agreed but this balance will come with time. Ideally you need people who understand both 0 to 1 + 1 to 100 + 100 to N
8/19/20, 20:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Some of us have consciously done this
8/19/20, 20:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Back to my earlier topic. How do companies survive years of 0 or low MDR without burning investor money? üòè
8/19/20, 20:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Some of us have said it doesn‚Äôt matter, we will figure along the way
8/19/20, 20:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why do they have to not burn Investor money?
8/19/20, 21:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As long as investors want to burn it.
8/19/20, 21:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Use, not burn.
8/19/20, 21:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Flipkart is called Indian Amazon
Ola is Indian Uber
And Razorpay Indian stripe
8/19/20, 21:01 - Vikas Business Phone: Revenues coming from
8/19/20, 21:01 - Vikas Business Phone: India market only
8/19/20, 21:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Even in home market, holding their turf is no easy matter against the global companies.  

I wonder how these companies would perform in global markets.

OLA in UK - havnt followed their progress but could be a good reference..
8/19/20, 21:02 - Vikas Business Phone: Please Read the question again
8/19/20, 21:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indian constitution is called Americanised British constitution.
8/19/20, 21:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is evolution
8/19/20, 21:03 - +91 90046 19987: Fintech with the help of partner cum investor can go global leveraging their global presence. My view
8/19/20, 21:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You can‚Äôt always skip a step
8/19/20, 21:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am surprised that people don‚Äôt understand the pain of first generation entrepreneurs
8/19/20, 21:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Very surprising
8/19/20, 21:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
8/19/20, 21:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Especially in a country like India
8/19/20, 21:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What u mean? U want companies to go global with revenue from Indian market? 

Which Indian startup has enough money to survive even just in India, without global money? üòÇ
8/19/20, 21:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is very weird, honestly.
8/19/20, 21:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah this is like not understanding economics.
8/19/20, 21:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The USD hegemony is not understood well.
8/19/20, 21:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We also forget per capita economics
8/19/20, 21:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I mean how detached are we from reality?
8/19/20, 21:07 - Vikas Business Phone: This message was deleted
8/19/20, 21:08 - Vikas Business Phone: Question is  
- majority revenue is from home country only 
- can  local Fintech become global 
- can revenues come from overseas operation or they will depend only on Home market revenue
8/19/20, 21:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Can I rephrase this into 1 question?

Can Indian fintech go global by getting more revenue from out of home markets vs home market?

Simpler to understand.
8/19/20, 21:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üëÜüèº
8/19/20, 21:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üëÜüèº
8/19/20, 21:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Which Indian Fintech company has an innovation it can call its own?
8/19/20, 21:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Keen to hear @917733889552‚Äôs personal view on this. Would Razorpay go head-on with Stripe in global markets?
8/19/20, 21:18 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: We have always evaluated developing countries which are high growth regions. It's simply a question of when, nothing else.
8/19/20, 21:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fair enough. 

So, would positive cash flow in local market be a criteria before moving overseas? 

Asking because of Ola‚Äôs UK venture, which I personally felt very ill-timed considering their unfavourable situation in India.
8/19/20, 21:26 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Did stripe had that criteria?
8/19/20, 21:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not sure if you have gone through this well enough - Ola UK is much more promising than Ola India on all metrics possible. Please talk to people in Ola.
8/19/20, 21:28 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But payment markets aren‚Äôt cab markets.
8/19/20, 21:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Hardly. I had followed a bit few months back. Initial traction was mostly from some aggressive driver acquisitions & discounting. Very negative outlook locally. Most have quit. At the time, I felt it had to do more with image building in India prior to IPO, which itself on a back bench now.
8/19/20, 21:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Talk to people in Ola India who are overseeing the project.
8/19/20, 21:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Life is relative.
8/19/20, 21:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Well.

Uber never had that criteria too, but OLA‚Äôs global expansion isnt anywhere comparable to that of Ubers.
8/19/20, 21:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which has prospered in London?
8/19/20, 21:31 - Razorpay Shashank Kumar Co- Founder NnR: Why does it need to?
8/19/20, 21:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Also, there was bit drama here due to Uber license issues in London. It seemed very likely Uber would get shut down, so there was an interest in a alternative.
8/19/20, 21:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am not sure if we are following news - Uber has a small chance of getting banned in SF, it‚Äôs home turf.
8/19/20, 21:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Startups will always need to find new ways.
8/19/20, 21:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We can‚Äôt look at yesterday to find answers of tomorrow all the time.
8/19/20, 21:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Just what I was saying. Competitors seem to be capitalising on these, but these knee jerk bans dont happen as easily in developed markets as in India. ‚ÄúUber ban‚Äù is happening in London from 3 years, but they still seem to be functioning normally. 

IF that happens eventually, Ola may benefit. If not?
8/19/20, 21:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Doesn‚Äôt matter
8/19/20, 21:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs a public company, it still doesn‚Äôt seem to go to $ 75 a share anytime soon
8/19/20, 21:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: At least not in a sustainable long term way, again it‚Äôs a public company
8/19/20, 21:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Private companies don‚Äôt need to follow the same path - That is the point
8/19/20, 21:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Private companies must know how, not necessarily when.
8/19/20, 21:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fintech is bit cleaner usually, with less surprises. Especially in Europe.

Tho, Revolut was an exception. They turned off AML checks for new signups to fasttrack growth.
8/19/20, 21:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And Mistertango got sanctioned for similar reasons.
8/19/20, 21:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Europe is a very bad place to judge startups, sorry.
8/19/20, 21:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is the least innovative of all continents, combined.
8/19/20, 21:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Small countries with per capita at 1/30th are beating Europe on innovation
8/19/20, 21:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Revolut got busted because of a whistle blower. üòÇ
8/19/20, 21:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What about WireCard?
8/19/20, 21:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The list is endless
8/19/20, 21:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Wirecard was not gray, its black.
8/19/20, 21:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Europe wants to live colonial life, 5 hour weekdays, 90 days of leave, with EU court + become an innovator.
8/19/20, 21:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not going to happen.
8/19/20, 21:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Tho, in Indian context, PayTM does a lot of similar business, by encouraging non-reportable transactions on their wallet.
8/19/20, 21:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So no Europe is a joke in startup innovation, it‚Äôs a great place to be an employee though. I mean amazing.
8/19/20, 21:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Bank vs Wallet advantages
8/19/20, 21:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sorry, we are deviating from the discussion at hand - my point is innovation takes time to notice.
8/19/20, 21:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fintech wise, I think not. There are some interesting ones here.
8/19/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes, which list in NYSE.
8/19/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sad no?
8/19/20, 21:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or is rather hilarious?
8/19/20, 21:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In terms of regulatory compliance too, its rather straight forward. Not as messy as US or India.
8/19/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Europe is a great place for services business for sure.
8/19/20, 21:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Product, not too sure. Not very conducive. Minus fringe places like Estonia.
8/19/20, 21:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Estonia has an Advantage of being in EU with India-like salaries üòÇ
8/19/20, 21:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, most companies there can actually innovate on a budget, and still have access to premium EU markets.
8/19/20, 21:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
8/19/20, 21:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In terms of India, I will give a small example: When I started my last startup back in 2015, I had to think of build every micro-services that I had to put into my product and this was reinventing the wheel + absolute waste of time + headaches of compliance + multi-party communication for many layers.

Today when I am building my next one, at least 5 micro-services are being solved by one fintech, all of which would be completely useless for me to build individually and I am therefore happy to pay the cost for these micro-service to this startup. It‚Äôs now possible because entrepreneurs of my age or around my age are solving problem of entrepreneurs like me.

No bank even comes close to solving any of this and I don‚Äôt see them coming close for another decade or so, and we know why.
8/19/20, 21:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All these products are international by default at a tech level, they just need a legal ok from the country they might want to launch in. This kind of product launches are happening today which are never even thought of or even possible in the past, especially in fintech. All of this is therefor just a matter of when and not if.
8/19/20, 21:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In India too, the regulatory hurdles are a turn off for many, especially in Fintech.
8/19/20, 21:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You dont know what bomb RBI will drop, when. üí£
8/19/20, 21:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Especially so when doing something ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù and not a tried and tested model.
8/19/20, 21:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: A lot of ‚Äúfinancial inclusion‚Äù projects from India, have a good chance at going global to developing markets. Not so much the mainstream payment companies. Just my 2 cents.
8/19/20, 22:02 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: No repatriation thou
8/19/20, 22:06 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Of course its allowed.
8/19/20, 22:07 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
8/19/20, 22:07 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Ayush that‚Äôs completely incorrect. Apart from the marketing $$ spent, there was hardly anything. It infact fizzled out faster than it grew. Covid spoilt it further. 
I have been in touch with the Ola launch head
8/19/20, 22:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They were encouraging Uber drivers to join Ola, work on both apps & then pass out Ola discount coupons to Uber passengers. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/19/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The fired guy?
8/19/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or the new guy in place?
8/19/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The ex-UK head was fired, right?
8/19/20, 22:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: A lot of drivers were actually doing that successfully too, for the referral fee.
8/19/20, 22:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I have heard two versions of the story from two sets of people, hence asking.
8/19/20, 22:14 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Lets not go into whether he was fired on moved on üòä
8/19/20, 22:15 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: But the point is, trying a way that works in India doesnt mean it would work in other geos
8/19/20, 22:15 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member on Can LOCAL FINTECH BECOME GLOBAL says* 


*View 62*  _CXO fintech_ 

We have to be a little more specific about what we mean by 'global'... When social, cultural, economic and political variations decide the acceptability of solutions... Universal acceptance is a rare phenomenon if not impossible.So, let us examine the nuances of being global first. Is acceptance of a solution in one country apart from its home country make it global? Or would acceptance in one continent apart from its home continent make it global... Or is Billability in one currency other than the home currency of the home country make it global?

I have not come across a proper, unanimously accepted definition of 'global' till now.

Therefore, the entire discussion is on a premise that is perceived differently by the different responders...

When we talk of Products  in Fintech... Multi Continental /Multi Country acceptance requires assimilation of user aspirations from different milieu all consolidated in a fully functional solution that can factor in the situational conflicts that may arise due to diversity of user aspirations
8/19/20, 22:15 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Yep
8/19/20, 22:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: The Oxford foundry guy?
8/19/20, 22:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: My point is this proves that this has been discussed and therefore I am sure both sides of the story are important. The December launch was mistimed for Europe. Very rookie stuff.
8/19/20, 22:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But I agree on the HR side of things
8/19/20, 22:16 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And thus By any stretch of imagination it wasn‚Äôt successful
8/19/20, 22:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
8/19/20, 22:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah very surprised at the line of people who moved out - UK + Aus
8/19/20, 22:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Thankfully Fintech doesn‚Äôt have to be that way, I have more confidence in our finsters.
8/19/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It was more a pre-IPO image building exercise, than a business decision, I feel.
8/19/20, 22:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: IPO lol ok
8/19/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: To be ‚Äúglobal company‚Äù! üòù
8/19/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
8/19/20, 22:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: See I am not going to debate Ola here because honestly I understand the sentiment and agree with it largely, my empathy is largely because of first generation entrepreneurial dreams.
8/19/20, 22:20 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: You may be right. Though there were always aspirations to go international and grow there considering these market were percieved as ‚Äúunder penetrated‚Äù and ‚Äúfrgamented
8/19/20, 22:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: He is right
8/19/20, 22:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Same with other divisions they have opened
8/19/20, 22:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Am of a bit pessimistic view towards companies focussing on image & valuation, over profitability. 

Its ruining the market to the extent that regular people who wish to do business to make profits cant survive anymore, and that pisses me off. Happy to see this vc-funded hype crumble.
8/19/20, 22:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Most of them are doing pathetic numbers
8/19/20, 22:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Same with acquisitions
8/19/20, 22:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Cant agree more

On the news of *GMAIL,DOCS, DRIVE And other APPS GOING DOWN* is asking question 

*Q1*: What is back-up if GOOGLE or WHATSAPP goes down for say 3 days? 

*Q2* Today entire start-up, SME sector is so dependent on WHATSAPP AND GOOGLE for its business. If these companies *black list* a particular country. Can you imagine what will happen to that country and it‚Äôs economy 

Invite your views & guidance on this concern


üõëIMPORTANT
*Kindly note*:  _we will share one or two best responses only in Participating communities. Rest can be read in the *FIAKS bespoke* which will be released later incorporating all the views_
https://www.fiaks.com/fiaks-bespoke/
8/20/20, 20:10 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: Reliance JIO is already working on the competitive products. So, per say, if Google is based in India, Indian companies doing business n India will not be effected.
But it will be good idea to bridge the services between the local service provider of each country similar to payment gateway used for multiple banks.
8/20/20, 20:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Q1. The backup is their valuation
Q2. Dependency will keep increasing, so will their share of the economy, but the value is big enough that there will always be fast competition
8/20/20, 20:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The beauty of these kind of products is that there is no need for permission to ask
8/20/20, 20:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But that‚Äôs not true for things like telco and banking and others - which is why monopoly in those places is so much more dangerous at scale
8/20/20, 20:26 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member says* 

We have back up plan for every product/situation in life. *But can‚Äôt think of any back up for these two tech companies*. The services offered are *so good* by these companies and it‚Äôs absolutely free..

Now they are into payment space too. So we will need banks only for opening Fixed Desposits?.. For rest all Google & whatsapp 

With *NEU regulation* posted yesterday they don‚Äôt need NPCI as they will be new competition to NPCI.. They will issue crypto currency so don‚Äôt need even RBI. 

Entire country will be dependent on whatsapp & google with no back up or alternative plans .. isn‚Äôt it ? 
So 
- *no bank needed*
- *no NPCI needed*
- *no RBI needed* 
- *no telecom needed* as they offer voice and messaging services 

Are we understanding the risk here ? Risk are at 
- *country level* 
- *company level* 
- *individual level*
8/20/20, 20:56 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community banker response* on BLACK OUT BY GOOGLE & WHATSAPP question say

I think the point made here is for those businesses that use G-Suite - which is Google's mail, documents, drive, etc...

*Aren' t 99% of SMEs and Start-up dependent on google & whatsapp for business?*
8/20/20, 21:00 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: What happens if you don't have electricity for 4-5 hours? Your business is stopped?? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You can't use different mailboxes using same domain. 
They take many measures in terms of backup, distributed architecture, load balancing etc.
But sometimes, **** Happens ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8/20/20, 21:31 - Vikas Business Phone: And what happens if electricity companies goes bankrupt ?

 Or  


What will happen if Google Or whatsapp black list India as per the directives from  the US government to them to do so.

What are the alternatives available

Not much....Alternatives will emerge quickly.... more interesting question should be what if USA govt black list india from MC / Visa etc?

*View 55*: Founder

India still has a share chat and Hike which has 250 Million and 100 Million user base..So i still feel we might have an answer for WhatsApp (although penetration like WhatsApp will take time for these brands)..The bigger problem is if Google stops operations in India..*There is a huge dependency on GOOGLE in India for various services which will have a bigger impact.*

*ABN AMRO*: _Second Quarter 2020 results_

_Financial highlights_
‚Ä¢As Q2 2020 results continued to be marked by the impact of Covid-19, our net result was around breakeven, mainly due to high impairment charges.
‚Ä¢Net interest income amounted to EUR 1,514 million (Q2 2019: EUR 1,681 million). Excluding the negative impact of incidentals, net interest income declined further, mainly as a result of continued pressure on
deposit margins and slightly lower average loan volumes and margins. The decline was partly compensated by charging negative interest rates to clients with deposits above EUR 2.5 million.  
‚Ä¢ Operating expenses excluding incidentals and divestments were slightly higher as the upscaling of AML activities was partly offset by continued execution of cost-saving programmes.
‚Ä¢ Impairment charges totalled EUR 703 million, mainly reflecting stage 3 impairments at CIB (mostly in the
oil & gas sector), a potential fraud case in Germany and the deteriorated economic outlook.
‚Ä¢ Strong liquidity position, with a sizeable buffer to meet liquidity needs.
‚Ä¢Capital position remains robust, with the CET1 ratio at 17.3% under Basel III and around 14% under Basel IV

8/24/20, 11:11 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS bespoke_ *Should There Be A Restriction Of One Customer One UPI ID?*

_Doesn‚Äôt it lead to a risk of money laundering?_

Firstly, it‚Äôs a defeat of the purpose of UPI i.e. convenience, specific purpose VPA, temporary VPA, etc. The idea behind making UPI open is to allow innovation to flourish and not get stifled by controls.

Customers can not only create multiple VPA in each bank but also the same bank account can be linked as a new VPA in PSPs too. And why not? That‚Äôs the whole advantage of VPA. No permanent binding like one account number, a label similar to a single-use virtual card number. The underlying bank account remains the same, anti-money laundering is at  the bank account level, not UPI ID, velocity checks are on the bank account, not UPI ID. Since,the volume & value limits for UPI are at the account level, hence having multiple UPI IDs doesn‚Äôt matter.

8/25/20, 23:02 - Vikas Business Phone: FIAKS community member  on the news of *NEO BANK SAD DEMISE IN EUROPE*  and related questions raised. 

*View 23*

A1 . No additional banking license required to serve the same 100 million customers. Sponsor bank relationships is the best way forward. 

RBI is run by professional with deep understanding of markets. Nothing wrong if the best practices from any other part of the world is replicated by regulators in the home country. 

Regulatory authorities will find it difficult to issue digital banking license.  *As the fresh license category may give advantage to digital banks over payments bank*. There will be no takers for any license category with  more restriction compared to  payments bank.

A2. The term Neo Bank is fashionable these days however I can share several successful usecases like eWallets, Agency banking, cross border remittances, gift card program  to name few.

A3. Core banking platform providers are unable to service the need of the bank who want to be agile like Fintech‚Äôs and looking for programable platform. They need platforms on which product can be configured within hours as against several months by the core banking  platform providers. 

A4. Yes core banking providers can surely service this requirement of the large banks. But it‚Äôs like making elephant dance. 
Please note they are already collaborating with several fintech companies to service these needs of the banks. Also the revenue side, banks are run smart bankers  who do ROI every product they launch. Some may not be profitable but that‚Äôs the cost of innovation and cost of learning 

Let regulatory not become another boss of the consumer banking heads. Regulators have better job to do.

  RBI if they cud do the current job of monitoring banks n there assets that will be good enough favor on this country specially the middle class...best they keep off reinventing licenses or categories...becoz the end result is key i.e. protection of investor money - absence of which is regretfully a recurring event...

Don't emulate the west they have better systems in place n have laws which provide better compensation than the mere 100000/- compensation against the crores. And individual investor with banks can loose due to corruption or inability to understand business proposals or the collateral offered as security etc

8/27/20, 00:07 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Having a digital banking licence is a good thing, similar to E-money or else PI licence in Europe. Both are different in scope and regulation, so RBI has to decide which way it is going to lead to. However, if it imposes the kind of restrictions that it did on payments banks then it will defeat the purpose.

Secondly, to spur innovation it makes sense to have a 2-tier licence, one which is bank sponsored and therefore ultimately the funds are held with and insured by a Tier1 bank. The second could be an independent licence which carries more responsibility and therefore also allows more flexibility to the new entrants.

Third and very important is to include international payments in the purview of digital banking licence. In today's age purely local banking has its own wide use case but it will severely limit innovation for global opportunities.

As to the 2nd question, neobanks are designed to solve for the consumer and not for the banking incumbents. Neobanks are designed around specific problems which are not solved by banks. This question is redundant because if banks were able to solve then neos would not exist.

Regulatory oversight on revenue of bank products does not exist per se, so whether its a regular bank or a neobank, there is hardly any role for a banking regulator to play. You could argue that sometimes neobanks have predatory pricing but:
a) considering that they are challengers and not incumbents, they can hardly be called predatory
b) pricing is always a model based on a mix of profitable and not-profitable products so it is wrong to single out pricing
c) with any bank you will have profitable and non-profitable customers, so again its hard to pin down what is fair pricing

*Technology Vision 2020*

Enterprises are facing their next big challenge. Up until now, businesses have largely benefited from following
the technology roadmap laid out by digital pioneers. Some are labelling today‚Äôs environment a
‚Äútech-lash,‚Äù or backlash against technology. But that description fails to account for the fact that we‚Äôre using technology more than ever. Rather, it‚Äôs a tech-clash‚Äîa collision between old models that are incongruous with people‚Äôs current expectations.

Ridiculous !

Will HDFC Bank become an NPA if the owners don't agree for the rent discount ?

*View 4* CXO BANKER

These are only strong arm bullying *unethical practices*. What if the owners get together and take a united stand.If the bank has to relocate several branches, the cost of relocation will exceed the savings in rent by taking the new premises.

8/28/20, 13:44 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Our office is on the second floor of a building which has Reliance Fresh on the ground floor and HDFC Bank on the first floor. Recently, I was trying to get a reduced rent from the building owner and he told me that Reliance and HDFC had both asked for a 20% reduction in rent much before us. Apparently, this was via what seemed like intimations rather than requests! He was pointing out the irony that we have an office which is largely empty with WFH for most of our team while both HDFC and Reliance Fresh facilities continue to be fully operational and quite busy and yet they had asked for a reduction much before we did.

*View 15* CXO BANKER

Banks reneging on their contractual commitments are the *worst kind of cheating possible*(esp those making profits) .  Contract Act is skewed in favor of the big and powerful (read your HL agreement and see how heavily it is loaded against borrower).  There is a pressing need for reform of contract Act to make it more equitable esp where contract is between unequals . It would mean certain grievance resolution mechanisms (ombudsman), prohibited clauses, unethical practices , onerous clauses to be made applicable to both sides ( in this case , if HDFC has a right to cancel the contract before term, the same right should be there for landlord also). *Our legal system has to go a long way from its colonial moorings*
8/28/20, 14:43 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on HDFC BANK asking for 20% cut on rent says_ 

*View 37* FOUNDER 

I am big fan of HDFC bank and they are extremely cost conscious. They know how to do business and the same time protect depositors money. 

What‚Äôs wrong in asking for rent reduction. Recently *kotak bank announced salary cut of treasury 10% for certain certain level. Did they take consent from all employees?*. Approach was take it or leave. 

Entrepreneurship success is all about handling  are these ill treatments that we all are use to it. 

Asking random reductions, threatening termination, not renewing, taking free services/trial run is BAU for all entrepreneurs whether it‚Äôs Bhaji wala or founder of large fintech. 

If you want bank to run profitable one need to cut cost and HDFC is smart to understand that rental is big expense rather than cutting down salary.

The copied version emerges to be more successful at times than the original because what matters, more importantly, is distribution than the product. It‚Äôs also about consumer tastes and preferences and their journey with the company. Again, yet another important factor is pricing and positioning strategy.

Copying products is not a bad idea at times the difference is how smartly you turn it out to your advantage. While you move towards copying as a strategy you need to be smart innovators on the other side well. Because aggressive innovation can overshadow your copied work and that‚Äôs what will make the product successful. Ultimately, progress and innovation win!

Indian names with surname combinations can pose a serious challenge when comparing two ID documents and many banking KYC gets rejected due to this name mismatch challenge. Many banks follow different practices. For ease of customer journey, it is better that we prevent abusive practices in the beginning by using multiple names matching algorithms in iterative mode.

9/1/20, 23:28 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: Imho, it's oversimplification to say that one app interface would eliminate all else.
For some time, the web browser was considered the ultimate app container.
Chat interface is another such interface in vogue now.
Voice is emerging as a strong contender while neural interfaces are considered the way of the future.

Each human computer interface has its strengths and weaknesses. 

A native app for now has the advantage of being the most feature rich since it essentially represents the super set of all that individual interfaces can achieve.
9/1/20, 23:30 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS community member in EXTINCTION OF MOBILE APP says* 

*View 7* CXO 

Chatbot development takes less time than mobile app development. Developers use services such as SnatchBot or Sprout for creating a chatbot with multi-tasking functionality.

By following simple logical steps and by understanding the customers‚Äô requests through a series of text messages, the bot guides the customers to their requested services. Routine queries are easily managed thru text messages. So my guess is instead 100 mobile app for particular functionality you will see may be 10 apps and 80 will be thru text message based queries. 

You can guess the future for Google pay, Phone pe , BHIM, Paytm and other apps
9/1/20, 23:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Oversimplified
9/1/20, 23:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I have tried every major chatbot out there, much more advanced than the ones named here
9/1/20, 23:34 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
9/1/20, 23:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You are mistaking algorithm + UX as product - That‚Äôs not the case
9/1/20, 23:35 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
9/1/20, 23:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Chatbots only works when underlying logic for the products are already pre-baked
9/1/20, 23:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In which case an app was never required
9/1/20, 23:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
9/1/20, 23:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Interfacing is not product, product is standardised solutioning at scale
9/1/20, 23:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The other name for this problem here is called mistaking feature for a product
9/1/20, 23:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: P2P / C2C chat is a product
P2M / C2M chat is a feature
9/1/20, 23:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In most constructs the above is true, not sure if this will make sense to everybody
9/1/20, 23:44 - Vikas Business Phone: Today for every  use case a mobile app is made.. Why do we need so many mobile apps when texting messages can solve it
9/1/20, 23:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We don‚Äôt - This a symptom of an underlying problem - feature as a product
9/2/20, 00:17 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts *EXTINCTION OF MOBILE APP* says_

*View 33*

*Mobile app* will not go *pager* way but will hit the stagnation like cards. Mobile 
app will become an *outdated technology* 

Most of the transaction that are today done by mobile app will be easily replicated by text messages .. the video that you showed above 

Let‚Äôs list down the typical transaction into the customer account 
1. Salary credit
2.Payments- P2P, P2M, Bill 
payment 
3. Local shopping like chai tapri  or vegetables buying *Cash*
4. EMI payments 
5. Maintenance bill of society 
6. Medical bills if any 
7. Restuarant bills *credit cards*
8. Petrol or diesel 
9. Shopping *credit cards*

All the above use cases (except credit card and cash) can be better experienced on text messages. All pay now buy now transaction that were done through debit or Mobile Apps will move to text based. 

Higher middle class and rich class will continue to be serviced by banks. Millennials luv texting and they shift easily from mobile apps. So which customer segment are these Mobile app going to target? ü§î
9/2/20, 00:36 - Fintech Aayush NnR: <Media omitted>
9/2/20, 00:37 - Vikas Business Phone: Agreed but when feature takes care of requirements why go for product
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is a fallacy
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 80% of startups fail because of this
9/2/20, 00:38 - Vikas Business Phone: Rental car services Vs buying out a car
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Other 15% fail because they make a product but not a business
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Renting a car is a product
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Think of the ecosystem
9/2/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And who can today run it successfully
9/2/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Avis can‚Äôt, Uber can
9/2/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: With change in technology, these understanding change very rapidly
9/2/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Zoom car can‚Äôt, Ola can
9/2/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Both are happening as we speak
9/2/20, 00:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Next level is always playing out - Mahindra and Maruti at some point will have stake in Ola and Uber.
9/2/20, 00:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the ecosystem is integrating further and further - this is how more products become featurised, and more features become irrelevant.
9/2/20, 00:41 - Vikas Business Phone: Check this view

9/2/20, 00:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sorry for being obtuse, but one of the easiest ways to hide feature as a product problem is under heavy use of technical jargon

9/2/20, 00:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sir I built an entire startups and raised $1.5 million in 2015 on this premise.
9/2/20, 00:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The underlying product is the context itself
9/2/20, 00:51 - Vikas Business Phone: Ok
9/2/20, 00:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What you are selling is more important than how you are selling
9/2/20, 00:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The chat helps because the mortgage exists / clothes exist / fridge exist / the make up exists / loan exists
9/2/20, 00:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The chat / buy button.
9/2/20, 00:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Banking has 3 products:
- Loans for businesses / consumers / Governments
- Financial risk assessment as a service to serve internal and external products, like insurance
- Government / regulatory / legal management for survival - Purely internal product
9/2/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: These 3 together making banking a great business
9/2/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Everything else is a feature
9/2/20, 00:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Avis & Uber cant be categorised together. 

Avis is self drive for long trips & Uber is chauffeured for point-to-point in-city short trips.
9/2/20, 00:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is why neo-Banks find it so hard to survive, because they don‚Äôt do No 3,  don‚Äôt have enough data to really meaningfully do No 2, and are not allowed to do No 1 well enough.
9/2/20, 00:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Keep watching the space soon.
9/2/20, 00:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Avis can‚Äôt be in business because what Avis does is akin to a feature building for Uber, the reverse however is not true.
9/2/20, 00:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All businesses ultimately boil down to liquidity on the platform and therefore liquidity of meeting demand and supply, in which demand will supersede supply in most occasions, if it‚Äôs an open market - Cars are open market, demand will dictate supply pricing, demand will dictate demand pricing - unlike, you guessed it, banks.
9/2/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Banks are artificially constrained by bankers and governments.
9/2/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So demand side doesn‚Äôt dictate terms as much. Supply side is largely artificial. So the platform is mostly hoax, unless you are in a couple of countries, I guess.
9/2/20, 01:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because ^
9/2/20, 01:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And ^, including chat or contextual chat or another UX mechanism, like Voice? Or someday thought based banking - Nuralink etc.

Those are ways of getting something done, not what is getting done.

This understanding is very essential.
9/2/20, 01:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Both Avis and Uber are in the cheapest total cost of running and owning a vehicle business, where Uber >>>>> beats Avis by miles and therefore those businesses will either be owned by the same owner / merge / acquire

Inter-city vs intra-city is a false dichotomy / competition. Both are variants of the same problem and both are volume led markets at both supply and demand end.

Therefore the conclusion is foregone.
9/2/20, 01:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not really. There is probably a bit overlap in India due to negligible cost difference between chaffeured & self-drive. Globally, anywhere else you go Avis / Hertz are primarily for long distance self-drive rentals, while Uber is for city point-to-point drops.
9/2/20, 01:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs what I am saying, this difference will go away.
9/2/20, 01:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Globally, not just in India.
9/2/20, 01:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You are either in volume market or value market, care are volume markets.
9/2/20, 01:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Highly unlikely
9/2/20, 01:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Ok, let‚Äôs take an open bet.
9/2/20, 01:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What are we betting?
9/2/20, 01:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All new cars are self-drive rentals, all mid-aged cars are chauffeur driven, all used cars are pure ride-hailing cabs.

The entire lifecycle is managed at scale by one company like Uber because they are the only kind of company (+ other ride hailing apps) that own the volume for such things to scale at the lowest total cost of ownership - Non-owned cars and non-owned riders are a non-differentiated commodity volume business, where lowest price will always win.

This is not an India phenomenon, it‚Äôs a global phenomenon, which will only speed up, but will perhaps be seen way more aggressively in India, because of price dynamics, but acquisition / merger in western markets will actually be faster, because the conclusion is foregone.
9/2/20, 01:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Uber model is asset light
9/2/20, 01:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Avis is exact opp
9/2/20, 01:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Albeit franchisee model
9/2/20, 01:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Seems unlikely Uber will move to a self drive rental model, where they need to own the car
9/2/20, 01:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In avis model, someone has to own the car. Its not p2p as such
9/2/20, 01:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Correct so guess how Uber / Ola are solving this problem?
9/2/20, 01:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Find out, it will be interesting.
9/2/20, 01:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/2/20, 01:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The owner owns, Uber only helps in pre-owning paper work, post-owning service attachment.
9/2/20, 01:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Ola is even more aggressive
9/2/20, 01:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They figured the entire lifecycle of a car right from the factory shop floor to scrap and they are right to do so
9/2/20, 01:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
9/2/20, 01:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Both are now busy making auto-tech products to make this even more efficient at scale - quite possibly one of their most important fund allocation avenues
9/2/20, 01:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
9/2/20, 01:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Avis is at $2.6 Billion trading at its 1999 price, Hertz is bankrupt 
whereas 
Uber is at $60 Billion valuation / Didi is at $57 Billion valuation / Lyft is at $ 15 Billion valuation / Grab is at $ 15 Billion valuation / Ola is at $ 6.2 Billion valuation.

How long till there is a leveraged buyout / hostile take over / acquisition?

1 year? 2 years? 5 years?
9/2/20, 01:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Similarly whether a transaction gets done by sms, chat, ussd, web, app, qr code, touch, card, voice, telepathy - that is just the method of transaction, not the business by itself.

This reality will hit a lot of new and old players very soon, MC and Visa included, forget PayTM vs PhonePe vs Google Pay - Making a transaction happen is

Large banks + large telcos + consumer tech giants have a humongous upper hand in product or distribution or both, and whosever wins those things wins the game, and you can see some players are trying to become all three without making a lot of noise.
9/2/20, 01:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: CBDCs could be a game changer in this.. in jurisdictions where govts take the initiative..
9/2/20, 01:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: CBDC isn‚Äôt economics, it‚Äôs politics.
9/2/20, 01:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And therefore only a real crisis can usher it in
9/2/20, 01:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is not unlikely far don‚Äôt see it less than a decade away, malice has to become very apparent, and has to hurt politically for it to take that that kind of decision.

My limited understanding is that CBDC will happen once UBI and DBT becomes global norm + Libra becomes real, and then a large fiscal problem happens, and $ vs RMB fight becomes global.

That‚Äôs a lot of coincidence and those many coincidences happening simultaneously is tough.
9/2/20, 01:57 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Interesting twist to Uber and Hertz is the Turo model which is self drive plus distribute ownership. Early days for this model and  it‚Äôs got different challenges compared to Uber and Hertz.
9/2/20, 01:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: How is Turo different from a Hertz?
It looks like Uber for Hertz, if that makes sense. I mean why can‚Äôt Uber beat them at this?
9/2/20, 02:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs basically AirBnB feeling for Hertz market, but that‚Äôs something that Uber can manage much better financially?
9/2/20, 02:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What‚Äôs the demand moat and supply moat?
9/2/20, 02:52 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Yeah it‚Äôs closer to Airbnb for Uber because Turo cars are owned by independent owners like Uber is but it comes without the driver which is the Hertz model.
9/2/20, 02:54 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: So in terms of simplifying it they take the driver out of the equation but that also excludes people who don‚Äôt want to drive. And then there‚Äôs short term self drive like Communauto and mid to longer term like Turo.
9/2/20, 02:55 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Supply moat in all of these models is creating enough availability
9/2/20, 02:56 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Demand moat is hard in early days till you build up supply. Use case is closer to replacing Hertz than replacing Uber.
9/2/20, 02:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its bit tricky, in terms of quality control. I would be less worried about quality of a car for a 15 min drive, but if I had to keep a car for a week, I would be lot fussier.
9/2/20, 03:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Hertz / Avis or any other rental company vs Turo, would be like a standard hotel chain vs Airbnb. The inconsistency maybe rather high.
9/2/20, 03:17 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: And that is def a barrier to demand. Similar to what Airbnb would have faced in their early days.
9/2/20, 03:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In most cities, Airbnb has an advantage mostly when looking for larger accomodation (flat vs hotel room) or option to accomodate more people.. (4 ppl in a 1 bedroom with bedroom+ sofa bed)..
9/2/20, 03:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: For a normal traveller who only needs a comfy ensuite room, Airbnb hardly is of any value. Infact, hotels are Cheaper & better. 

In context of Turo, I dont see them having an Airbnb kind of value add to a customer

9/2/20, 23:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: infact, i dont even pay it manually anymore.. its on auto-debit!
9/2/20, 23:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I bank with citi - and have cards from amex, icici, hdfc - none of these guys - provide me an easy way to pa - sometimes not even a decent reminder for me to pay on time
9/2/20, 23:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Insight - indian consumers dont like to auto pay - they  like to go through expenses before they pay
9/2/20, 23:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Hmmmm
9/2/20, 23:45 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Amex  website - powered thru billdesk - used to earlier take 3 days to settle money in my bank a/c - i was doomed if i paid over the weekend (more days)

9/2/20, 23:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Dont banks allow you to add all cards as bill payments?
9/2/20, 23:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: NO
9/2/20, 23:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And do you get rewards substantial enough to keep ypu interested to use Cred?
9/2/20, 23:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I remember seeing some option like that in ICICI & HDFC net banking..

am not much of a credit card guy, so not delved into it much..
9/2/20, 23:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Interesting tho..
9/3/20, 00:02 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The rewards initially were pretty decent. Covid has changed the nature of rewards
9/3/20, 00:02 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: None that i have seen
9/3/20, 00:03 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: You will feel like crying if you see hdfc credit card web portal
9/3/20, 00:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Covid has made it worse but they were getting progressively worse anyway
9/3/20, 00:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But to my understanding it is strategic
9/3/20, 00:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You will see why soon
9/3/20, 00:05 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Technically you can pay a card by the card # etc but for layman its a really tough task
9/3/20, 00:06 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: My reason to belive cred works - my mom can pay her credit card bill herself
9/3/20, 00:06 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: For me this is the litmus test
9/3/20, 00:07 - Fintech Ravi Pynda Ravikanth NnR: Only some banks like hdfc axis Kotak indus supports imps and rest of the banks  Supports NEFT payments .
9/3/20, 00:09 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: This is also okay
9/3/20, 00:10 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: HDFC too

9/3/20, 00:10 - Vikas Business Phone: üòÉ
9/3/20, 00:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: For every card I have, I have a SB account in the same bank. So, its been kind of seamless.
9/3/20, 00:11 - Fintech Ravi Pynda Ravikanth NnR: May be they do other banks through payouts
9/3/20, 00:11 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: my point is, earlier it would take 3 days; now it happens same day with cred + the convenience of seeing, getting reminded and paying centrally at one place - almost instantly
9/3/20, 00:11 - Vikas Business Phone: Yes. He is
9/3/20, 00:11 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I sometime feel that banks have a vested interest in making the credit card payments not so easy - late fee and interest is the biggest revenue for a CC
9/3/20, 00:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Fair enough. 

So, next question; how does cred make money when you pay your credit card bill? Lol
9/3/20, 00:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Where are the rewards coming from? Sequoia? üòù
9/3/20, 00:16 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: It doesnt. Possibly burns some VC money to "acquire and retain". ;) And as a consumer i could care less.. Buy on a serious note, it gives you points - which are aspirational to some extent and give you sense of "earning" even though it may not be as real. And then using those points you buy merchandise - right fro a phone accessories, perfumes, personal grooming and so on. And how you buy them is pay partly through points (generally capped to 10%-20% of the value of merchandise) and rest through real money. And "growing" brands see it as a marketing platform, so Cred would be earning there.
9/3/20, 00:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Would you be happy if Cred, for now, overtook the super bad point gathering scheme called PayBack?
9/3/20, 00:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And became the default loyalty point system, to begin with?
9/3/20, 00:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Payback is paid from IC!
9/3/20, 00:17 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Kunal has brought in the FreeCharge model of marketing brands and products on cred too
9/3/20, 00:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For now, let‚Äôs say Cred is a better PayBack
9/3/20, 00:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Much better
9/3/20, 00:18 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I would disagree to begin with
9/3/20, 00:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Wait for 1/2 weeks
9/3/20, 00:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Max 3/4
9/3/20, 00:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You missing the point. Payback is issuer driver & revenue/points come from IC.. 

Cred is 3rd party.
9/3/20, 00:19 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: We are talking about today
9/3/20, 00:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not sure if this is a feature or a bug
9/3/20, 00:19 - Fintech Aayush NnR: From Cred‚Äôs standpoint, they gain over incumbent
9/3/20, 00:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Incumbent is not the point
9/3/20, 00:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: In VC game, it is
9/3/20, 00:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Point is, Icici passes on part of interchange to fund ur payback
9/3/20, 00:20 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Totally agree. Cant compare Apples and Oranges
9/3/20, 00:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Cred is burning VC money to give u rewards
9/3/20, 00:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: At some point, someone else will do the same via Cred
9/3/20, 00:21 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yet at the same time, Cred gets the consumption and unsecured loan data for the people who matter and will matter for the next 2/3 decades
9/3/20, 00:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Right. Lets see you raise 1 crore from a VC, with that justification for a revenue model! üòÇ
9/3/20, 00:21 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Party yes. I am sure they are making money with brands using it as a marketing platform; though small today
9/3/20, 00:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: How on earth did he raise ‚Çπ1500cr to do that?
9/3/20, 00:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Come on, is that too obvious an answer?
9/3/20, 00:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÖ
9/3/20, 00:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Who won‚Äôt give you that if you sold your company for $400-450 Million in 2015?
9/3/20, 00:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: But imagine if you are a brand you are being told that the footfalls are from all credit worthy people with cibil scores if 650+. So brands would pay to grow
9/3/20, 00:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: its CaC for them, possibly at a cheaper cost
9/3/20, 00:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Depends, I don‚Äôt personally agree with this, but yeah the hamster wheel might run for sometime because of D2C brands
9/3/20, 00:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For acquisition
9/3/20, 00:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There lies the difference
9/3/20, 00:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Cred is not FB equivalent
9/3/20, 00:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Disclaimer; past performance is no guarantee of future results üòÇ
9/3/20, 00:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Cred can‚Äôt be used meaningfully as a marketing tool beyond launch

9/3/20, 00:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah no that‚Äôs not a worry at all
9/3/20, 00:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If a GDPR-clone is implemented in India, game over!
9/3/20, 00:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Dude GDPR is a joke
9/3/20, 00:24 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I mean that literally
9/3/20, 00:25 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Thats half the businesses wiped out, not just cred
9/3/20, 00:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Only EU took it seriously and even they are giving up
9/3/20, 00:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I am very pro-GDPR, tbh.
9/3/20, 00:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: We live in a post privacy world
9/3/20, 00:25 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sure, because you understand your data‚Äôs value
9/3/20, 00:25 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Dont agree. What is true though is Indians dont care
9/3/20, 00:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Basic idea; User owns his own data and nobody else.
9/3/20, 00:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You run for EU president and we will support you with a like on your favourite social network
9/3/20, 00:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Its not all that unreasonable?
9/3/20, 00:26 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Or even know what that day may mean for others
9/3/20, 00:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: You educate the world about it, we will support you from the sidelines
9/3/20, 00:26 - Fintech Aayush NnR: From this WhatsApp group etc
9/3/20, 00:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. Herein lies the issue. You can bribe ppl cheap, for their data.

Though, users should be given the power to withdraw consent anytime they wish. Thats the real
power of GDPR.
9/3/20, 00:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let us know how you plan to raise that money and how much time you are willing to spend on that education
9/3/20, 00:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
9/3/20, 00:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In India, marketing SMSs & calls, who doesn‚Äôt hate them?
9/3/20, 00:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: iPhone doesnt even have an option to block SMSs from non-numbers
9/3/20, 00:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: People need to realise GDPR like law would give them the control to not be called or messaged without their explicit permssion.
9/3/20, 00:29 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Has now (filtering) as a part of iOS 14 beta :)
9/3/20, 00:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: OMFG. Finally!
9/3/20, 00:30 - Fintech Aayush NnR: <Media omitted>
9/3/20, 00:30 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Too hard to drive that awareness in India still
9/3/20, 00:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Is there a privacy law coming even?
9/3/20, 00:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Anything brewing?
9/3/20, 00:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Everything Apple is doing is for reasons beyond altruism
9/3/20, 00:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 30% cut isn‚Äôt cheap
9/3/20, 00:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Just because it‚Äôs being taken from someone else
9/3/20, 00:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Neither will it‚Äôs new and evolved as platform
9/3/20, 00:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Am usually pro-apple, but Epic games fiasco is not cool.
9/3/20, 00:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Apple isn‚Äôt phasing out ads, it‚Äôs launching its own ad system - Everybody is playing the same game.
9/3/20, 00:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So absolutely no holier than thou whatsoever
9/3/20, 00:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not even close
9/3/20, 00:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Epic needs to win this case.
9/3/20, 00:33 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Is there a platform that charges cheaper?
9/3/20, 00:33 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Is google, amazon store or even steam (for games) cheaper
9/3/20, 00:34 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: When Doom started selling in Physical stores, it Paid 50%  to the stores BTW
9/3/20, 00:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs a physical store
9/3/20, 00:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs not comparable
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As for online stores it doesn‚Äôt matter
9/3/20, 00:35 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I am not comparing
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: EU has ruled already on auto parts
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is the principle argument
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is no holier than thou
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs all the same
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And US has ruled on that Kodak
Came
9/3/20, 00:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Case*
9/3/20, 00:35 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The market decides the cost - which for a decade has been 30%
9/3/20, 00:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Apple decided it. Not market.
9/3/20, 00:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Who charged that much prior to IOS?
9/3/20, 00:36 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And others followed
9/3/20, 00:36 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: to make the market
9/3/20, 00:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Exactly
9/3/20, 00:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is how it works
9/3/20, 00:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So for personal data, it‚Äôs a free market as well
9/3/20, 00:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Again not an even steven comparison
9/3/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So Apple should pay $ to every individual Apple product owner
9/3/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And then make it a market
9/3/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And give 70% cut to the user
9/3/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Keep 30% for itself
9/3/20, 00:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So that it can set the market standard for everyone else to follow, yet again
9/3/20, 00:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Your whims and fancies :)
9/3/20, 00:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
9/3/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: A market is supply vs demand vs competition.
9/3/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs the same for every market
9/3/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let all markets find their own answers
9/3/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Apple and GDPR included
9/3/20, 00:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And who is stopping that
9/3/20, 00:40 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: For some GDPR works; for some it doesnt
9/3/20, 00:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No one - which is the point - nobody is holier than thou, all of us use the same mechanics to make money
9/3/20, 00:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Personal data is nobodies to sell or capitalise on, other than the person himself. So, not comparable.
9/3/20, 00:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs easier to see it when it‚Äôs not the hand that feeds
9/3/20, 00:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is true for all of us all the time
9/3/20, 00:40 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I perosnally agree to that too
9/3/20, 00:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So educate people to not consent on stuff on the web etc
9/3/20, 00:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They will get to know it‚Äôs value
9/3/20, 00:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: A market will naturally evolve
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, I do have something in the pipeline which we are building for EU.. tho, it could apply to India too.
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Of course you do
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I dont know how much adoption it would see in India tho, without a privacy law.
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why else is this debate worth having
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
9/3/20, 00:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Lobby for it
9/3/20, 00:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: ^
9/3/20, 00:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not at all. This topic was an offshoot of Cred‚Äôs business model
9/3/20, 00:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòá
9/3/20, 00:44 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Was a complete segue rather :)
9/3/20, 00:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: At least with you both I can have this discussion
9/3/20, 00:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: With most others I would say yes, yes, yes
9/3/20, 00:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And then ask phir launch kab kar rahe ho boss?
9/3/20, 00:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this compliance project came about from personal frustration of unlimited number of emails in my inbox
9/3/20, 00:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: honestly no way to keep track of what data of mine, is with which companies..
9/3/20, 00:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I share the same frustration.
9/3/20, 00:48 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: 100+ spam emails every day, try unsubscribing and the spam grows by 5% more. Almost countless messages and unfailingly religiously at-least half a dozen calls without any context - complete cold calls
9/3/20, 00:49 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yes. exactly why you need GDPR in India too! :P
9/3/20, 00:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: If i had voting rights in support of it - i am in already - as you can see :)
9/3/20, 00:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Ayush might not - as we can see too :)
9/3/20, 00:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: üòú
9/3/20, 00:50 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: If my understanding is not wrong, data privacy law is passed and awaiting some node which will be similar to GDPR and it will be called IDPR.
9/3/20, 00:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ahaa! there we are..
9/3/20, 00:50 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Btw - this is My bigger worry is how it is implemneted

9/3/20, 00:53 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: <Media omitted>
9/3/20, 00:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ when was this?
9/3/20, 00:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Today
9/3/20, 00:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: interesting..
9/3/20, 00:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: no kidding! was that inn response to our discussion here? üòÇ
9/3/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I want it to happen but it won‚Äôt happen, and we know why.
9/3/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Most startup groups at a certain level have discussed it
9/3/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: They know it because some of their senior staff is in the same circles
9/3/20, 00:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs an amazingly good inside joke
9/3/20, 00:55 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Its been on twitter all day
9/3/20, 00:55 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And it wont go away from my timeline at all - with someone, liking commenting or retweeting
9/3/20, 00:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ohhh
9/3/20, 00:56 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Thats why - Kunal understands India like no one else :)
9/3/20, 00:57 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: and basically consumer psyche
9/3/20, 00:58 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not that I want to rant about it but see the crop he has been able to pick right from 2010 and who they are, what they have done, both within his companies, and outside of it. It takes a lot to be this driven to build stuff. Most people will fail, both seasoned and unseasoned folks.
9/3/20, 00:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: exactly why I would expect someone of his profile to build something SOLID, that would make a difference..
9/3/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs just perception
9/3/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Cred can be big
9/3/20, 00:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: by solid, I dint mean size/value wise..
9/3/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Credit is India‚Äôs second biggest problem by far, if not first
9/3/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I know what you mean, I am saying it in that respect
9/3/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: People build what markets value.
9/3/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs not forget that, as we speak.
9/3/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And you only have 1 lifetime
9/3/20, 01:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And there is a lot to do in that life
9/3/20, 01:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: hmmmm.. he hopefully has something up his sleeve..
9/3/20, 01:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Credit is India‚Äôs second largest problem to solve by volume, India‚Äôs largest problem to solve by value
9/3/20, 01:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: By far
9/3/20, 01:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Nothing comes close
9/3/20, 01:02 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Everyone who is on this group today and was in the group in the past or will be in the group tomorrow, would really like selling you credit, if they could
9/3/20, 01:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: https://youtu.be/_sUpFTtx_CA
9/3/20, 01:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is world‚Äôs biggest business, possibly also world‚Äôs oldest, in a lot of ways
9/3/20, 01:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: agree. so, you are implying the current model of Cred is only to acquire customers to whom they can lend?
9/3/20, 01:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: interesting discussion in the context of 0 MDR + GDPR / monetising customer data..
9/3/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is no other business model that will fit their valuation
9/3/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Simple argument
9/3/20, 01:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: A math problem is either inductive or deductive, can‚Äôt be neither.
9/3/20, 01:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: a few years back, in this group itself, I suggested this 0 MDR model (or a GST input credit for MDR).. at that time, I recommended govt should cover the MDR from GST collections, due to potential for higher GST collection from higher digitisation..
9/3/20, 01:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Obvious isn‚Äôt it?
9/3/20, 01:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: possibly. lets see. will be interesting to watch what they get upto.
9/3/20, 01:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 0 MDR will happen, the only question is when, not if.
9/3/20, 01:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It doesn‚Äôt even depend on the government anymore
9/3/20, 01:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this whole concept of monetising consumer data, in exchange for free MDR is a mess.. and ugly..
9/3/20, 01:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: totally unethical.. its digital prostitution..
9/3/20, 01:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: actually, more like forced digital prosttitution..
9/3/20, 01:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: lol
9/3/20, 01:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
9/3/20, 01:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is the future, only question is if that‚Äôs the future of 2020 or 2021 or 2023 or 2025 or 2030
9/3/20, 01:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Pay 5% and get away from it
9/3/20, 01:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/3/20, 01:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: we need to rope in a few feminists..

No means No. My body. My Rules
9/3/20, 01:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: should apply to data too.  not just body.
9/3/20, 01:19 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: lol
9/3/20, 01:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah so you have the option of choosing 5% and immediate payment
9/3/20, 01:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And no data
9/3/20, 01:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or 0% + time delayed settlement + data selling
9/3/20, 01:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let the market decide and adjust the %age number accordingly
9/3/20, 01:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because
9/3/20, 01:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: anyway, been a long discussion. .lets not spam the group further.
9/3/20, 01:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Lets look at the brighter the group has only some 40ish participants today, only 10 of whom care, 5 of whom have an opinion
9/3/20, 01:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: 3 of whom can state it openly
9/3/20, 01:27 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Good to be in the minority sometimes
9/3/20, 01:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÅ
9/3/20, 01:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The above is a joke, don‚Äôt take it too seriously
9/3/20, 01:29 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All characters are completely fictional or coincidental.
9/3/20, 01:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I think 37 are sleeping! It‚Äôs late there, isnt it? üòù
9/3/20, 01:48 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Ajay And Aayush = AAA rated conversation :)
9/3/20, 01:49 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Unfortunately though most of the good convos happen during working hours for me
9/3/20, 01:49 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: I mean the part of the 24x7 cycle when I actually pretend I'm working
9/3/20, 01:49 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: ü§£
9/3/20, 01:50 - Vikas Business Phone: Agree üëç

9/4/20, 00:00 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Expert shared a post that is  trending on LinkedIn on *Calling RBI to answer the court on loan waiver*_

_Lending institutions borrow from Peter and Paul and lend to Tom, Dick and Harry. If you decide to ask us to waive off interest charged to the latter group during the moratorium,  I hope you also mean that we do not pay interest to the former group too_.

_Banks can waive off interest payable by their borrowers by also waiving off interest payable to their depositors. Contracts if broken have to be broken both sides_.

_In a plea before you RBI has informed that the amount at stake is a staggering 1% of GDP- over Rs. 2 trillion.  That‚Äôs just banks, NBFCs and HFCs on top of this_. 

_Surely you know there is no such thing as a free lunch. If those that took a loan do not pay then unfortunately those who did not take the loan will end up paying for it_

_Calling RBI to answer the court in a matter over which it has both the expertise and jurisdiction itself is unfortunate and then to accuse the government of hiding behind RBI isn‚Äôt that a judicial overreach ?_

_If every matter is to be decided by the Supreme Court then judiciary is attempting to take over the role of executive and by challenging the authority and sanctity  of regulatory bodies it weakens them_

A lot of these guys have gone bottoms up too, and startup is more a mindset, no fancy corporate board, no legacy cash flows, it is the pride of sweating and toiling and building things from scratch, we should not discriminate here, hell if someone is from IIT let's remember that they toiled to get there too! Unfortunately or fortunately world measures success by money especially in business. That doesn't mean anyone who dared to do something on their own is not being celebrated!

The _2020 Aid Transparency Index by PWYF_ shows significant improvement in donors‚Äô overall transparency compared to 2018. 

The 2020 Aid Transparency Index shows a mixed picture of some donors continuing to perform well, others making significant progress, and some treading water, with few changes or improvements in their aid transparency over the past two years. There are also persistent issues with disclosure of project performance data as well as contracts and tender information and sub-national locations of activities.


Aid transparency should also inform learning and evaluation both during and after the crisis. By publishing timely results and evaluations‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîaid donors can monitor the progress of interventions and learn from what works, what does not work, and why. As the human impact on the natural world increases the likelihood of more pandemics in the future, it is imperative that we take full advantage of the learning opportunities from the current mobilisation of international aid so that we may be better prepared to prevent or respond to future outbreaks.

9/4/20, 19:54 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community thought leader on *CALLING RBI TO ANSWER THE COURT ON LOAN WAIVER*_

He says Banks borrow from Paul and Peter at 3.5%. Despite RBI opening up the interest rates 10 years back no bank of significance has increased interest rate.

Banks lend to Tom dick and Harrry at 15% plus going all the way up to 30%. Banks infact also lend to oberois, shahs and Mehta‚Äôs for swanky cars and fourth/fifth house at under 12% and infact banks lend to As and Bs and Gs of corporate world at under 10%. By borrowing from peter and Paul at 3.5%. Tom dick and Harry get only fraction of what peter and Paul give to banks 

Where the does the difference go? Either one of the big guys defaults or bank‚Äôs Intelligencia gets fat salaries.

Now when economy is in bad shape and Tom dick and Harry need support. Govt is extending support. Where are banks sending it? To As, Bs and Gs. TLTRO I, II, PCgS, all data is showing 

And now they want to complain about fairness and justice!
9/4/20, 20:38 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on Calling *RBI TO ANSWER THE COURT ON LOAN WAIVER*_

*View 3* _Banking Expert_ 
This is not based on facts. Bank don't borrow at 3.5 % from so called Peter n Paul, Nor they finance at 15 % to 30%. See the rates in website which hover around 7 to 12 %.

RBI Circular: on (MCLR) for the month August 2020 ( refer the excel sheet) 

*View 4* _Banking & Fintech Expert_
this is just a reference rate. Like LIBOR. Your interest is a margin over this. If you see your home loan or car loan or business loan letter it would say MCLR plus x%. *Only inter-bank borrowing happens at this rate*

*FAB query?*  what is MCLR 
Marginal Cost of Fund based lending Rate 

The *MCLR* and *Base Rate* may appear to be quite similar on the surface. After all, they were implemented with the same objective in mind and are loosely based on similar principles. However, there are crucial factors in each case which separate the two rates. The differences have been tabulated as shown below.

*Base Rate*
 -Based on average cost of funds
-Calculated by considering minimum rate of return/profit margin
-Base is also governed by operating expenses, and expenses needed to maintain cash reserve ratio

*MCLR*
-Based on marginal/incremental cost of funds
-Calculated by considering tenor premium
-The MCLR is also determined by considering deposit rates and repo rates, along with operating
-costs and cost of maintaining cash reserve ratio

(An undergraduate shares an information on *Physical Digital Combination* from his latest readings). 

He says, Companies that embrace a *human-machine collaboration* have seen more than *thrice* the level of operational performance improvements than those which used AI tools to substitute workers. 

Looking back at history, when third industrial revolution technologies started to catch the attention of humans, we believed that  new technologies would make us lose our jobs to an efficient alternative. A good example can be seen in the World's largest economy itself.  As early as in 1964, a memorandum was sent to the president of the United Statesüá∫üá∏, Mr.Lyndon B.Johnson that envisioned a '*cyber nation revolution*' and would result in a systematic capacity of almost unlimited productivity and replace human labour. But not many things were found to be true in practice.

While reliance is going to entrench consumers with a plethora of services to get them in the fold of ecommerce, social, entertainment, payments - which will grow
Vs 
SBI that already sits on a pile load of consumers who are not going to grow or-spend more with services like Yono and possibly are looking at newer ways of banking and payments, where yono isnt there yet. 

Infact its likely that the mindshare of these consumers would be eaten by google fb amazon like services which may get horizontally integrated with Reliance ‚Äúplatforms‚Äù imo

Banks have and continue to lose the opportunity, to give users simple yet powerful avenues to spend - whether it is paying a bill or otc w/ merchants or p2p

9/10/20, 22:10 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: =====================
The acronym FOMO may be relatively new, but the fear of missing out has driven human beings since time immemorial. Our social herd instincts naturally push us towards choices that others are making. And the greater the wealth or power gap between us and those whose choices we‚Äôre told about, the stronger our desire to want the same.
 
If you‚Äôre a parent, though, FOMO gets amplified exponentially. Because, now, you‚Äôre compensating for the choices you never got while trying to ensure your child more than makes up for it. FOYKMO >>> FOMO. (YK = Your Kid.)
 
This is why education is such a powerful, emotional and, if well run, profitable business. Parents will spare no expense when it comes to their kids' education.
 
WhiteHat Jr, a two-year-old company that teaches kids how to code, was distilled FOMO. Which is why Byju‚Äôs, India‚Äôs leading edtech company and its only decacorn (worth $10 billion or more), swooped in to buy WhiteHat Jr for $300 million in cash last week even while the startup was looking to raise $50 million in venture funding.
 
After reading Sumanth‚Äôs story today analysing WhiteHat Jr, I‚Äôm honestly in awe of the sheer cleverness of their business model, marketing strategy, and execution.
 
Three million students, 5,000 teachers and $150 million in an annual ‚Äúrun rate‚Äù in just two years is next-level stuff. Especially if you don‚Äôt even have to hire teachers, because WhiteHat Jr is a two-sided platform that pays teachers Rs 275 ($3.7) per hour while charging students Rs 600 ($8) per hour.
 
What about developing curriculum? Most of its course content is not proprietary either. Its lessons are sourced directly from material already created by others like Blockly or Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúCode with Google‚Äù.
 
That leaves it to just create a tremendously well-orchestrated FOYKMO engine which convinces parents that coding will be the new lingua franca for the future. Wouldn‚Äôt they want their kid to be ‚ÄúWolf Gupta‚Äù?
 
Who is Wolf Gupta, you may ask? Please read Sumanth‚Äôs story, is what I‚Äôd answer: https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-300-million-acquisition-whitehat-jr/ (15-minute read)

9/10/20, 22:36 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on *YONO being called START-UP*_

üõë *View 35* CXO 

He say so you have this whole thing intrapreneur where while working in a large organization, you come up with new ideas and thoughts and eventually build a product and a business. 3M is one of the earliest pioneers of this concept. so yes, even in an established organization we can still have startups.
Whether sbi yono qualifies or not I am not sure, as clearly yono had a lot of unfair advantages, which a typical startup will never ever have. almost *limitless funding, entire consumer base* of sbi and muscle power of the bank. never had to fight for intrastructure or people. so i am not sure if it ticks the boxes as a startup at all.

üõë *View 42*. CXO
Q2 - what would be the objective of this? I am sure there are enough and more metrics to define a startup. About awards, well the less said the better! amazing how many of the best cio/best so-and- *so awards are actually purchased/influenced*

i am sure none of the known startups worked for an award - they worked for solving a real world problem, and in the process, few of them made pot loads of money for their founders!

9/11/20, 08:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. Agree.

Calling Yono a startup, is like calling the new S-class a new startup by Mercedes OR AirPod a new startup by Apple. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If s-class brand is spawned off as a separate entity, or Airpod is separated from apple, they are also worth billions on their own NOW. 

Would they be so, on their own, without the backing of the parent company? Definitely not. 

So, its outright lame to make such a claim. Its just a new product by a large entity.
9/11/20, 08:37 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Creating a product and scaling it massively is what a startup does. And the similarity ends there.
9/11/20, 08:40 - +65 9172 8895: We do know you can‚Äôt access SBI without Yono? So if Payzapp or Pockets was the only source of accessing HDFC/ICICI then they would be right here. Waise no idea why they are not

9/11/20, 08:50 - +65 9732 7516: SBI YONO is an app migration and update from SBI anywhere which was sunset. 
Will not comment on the product as would agree with Ishan there. Also there are two YONO right now - YONO and YONO lite.

As a product lot of things to solve still. Possibly which may require some changes in legacy systems and processes. 

The good thing about YONO and earlier SBI anywhere has been the ability of SBI Branches to get a senior demographic to download the app. 
That's one of the strengths of the SBI Branch Distribution team. They are using their relationships well to get customers to at least have the app on phone. 
Usage is of course driven by how the product experience is.

9/12/20, 04:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Big for UK Fintech!

Cutting-edge digital & data provisions that go far beyond the EU-Japan deal. These will enable free flow of data whilst maintaining high standards of protection for personal data. We have also committed to uphold the principles of net neutrality, as well as introducing a ban on data localisation, which will prevent British businesses from having the extra cost of setting up servers in Japan. This will help UK fintech firms operating in Japan - like Revolut and Transferwise - to innovate and grow.
Improved market access for UK financial services ‚Äì including greater transparency and streamlined application processes for UK firms seeking licences to operate in Japan. The deal creates an annual dialogue between Her Majesty‚Äôs Treasury, UK financial regulators, and the Japanese FSA that will explore ways to further reduce regulatory friction - something that would be impossible were the UK still in the EU.

(An undergraduate shares an information on why Vladimir Putin has named Russia's *COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine  as SPUTNIK V* basis his latest readings from _start up nation_ )


He says the history behind the invention of *Sputnik I* is equally enthralling. During the post-WW2 boom years, America‚Äôs global status was suddenly punctured when Russia(formerly USSR) upstaged the USA üá∫üá∏ by launching the *world's first Space satellite *SPUTNIK 1*

Innovation economist John Kao claimed that *SPUTNIK I* was a wake-up call that proved to be a boon for the US economy. The US government passed the national defence education act for *$900M* ($6B in current prices)providing scholarships, student loans and scientific equipment for schools across the US.

This resulted in the *CREATION OF NASA* and the *APOLLO MOON MISSION*

What followed gave birth to entirely new business sectors within Avionics and
telecommunications, the most of popular of them being the *INVENTION OF THE INTERNET* itself.

National Umbrella Entity( *NUE*) is Regulatory guideline which invites applications to create *NPCI like institution in the country*.  Regulators is allowing *for profit organisation* to enter this space. Community is questioning

*Q1* Will *for  profit organisation* ever work on products that will cater for *non-Smartphone users* or *users who do not have any devices*‚ùì

*Q2* Will *for  profit organisation* ever work on products to win for the *bottom of pyramid customers*‚ùì

*Q3* have you ever seen for  profit organisation i.e  *MNC bank/ Private banks* ever sold *no frill accounts* to customers ‚ùìor shown any interest in opening branches in rural areas ‚ùì

BIG QUESTION IS WHY DO WE NEED ANOTHER NPCI ? *Why can‚Äôt NPCI be the umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è entity itself* and let various new organisations for profit or for non-profit be part of existing NPCI. 

_Invite your views and guidance on this subject_

2. Will for profit organisation for anything ever work on products to win for bottom of the pyramid? Yes. It has happened everywhere, will happen in banking too, that‚Äôs why entrepreneurs exist, employee mindset won‚Äôt solve.

3. Why should any organisation sell any service or product which has nothing to gain for the company itself? Including Government organisations.

We have a very socialistic mindset by default and this is nowhere else more harmful than in banking institutions because this is where money starts circulating.

In any space that exists, competition is almost always best way for the sector to do well for everyone, including bottom of the pyramid customers.

NUE license to be made available *on tap* to any one who fulfills the criteria of regulator. Make all the systems *interoperable* rather than building proprietary once. 

More competition.. more innovations .. more alternatives.. newer market segment would be tapped

Allowing for profit is good. *Promoter entity is here for profitable business  and not charity*. Remember PSU Banks were forced to invest in NPCI. 

I would say disqualify *not for profit* applications.
9/14/20, 20:44 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: NPCI occupies a gray zone in trying to be both a private organization and a policy enforcer. This was kind of evident when the BHIM app was launched with much fanfare by the Govt. There were questions on why private UPI apps need to exist. Today, due to a multitude of reasons, the non-BHIM apps are miles ahead in user adoption. I think I can make the rather bold assertion that without GooglePay and PhonePe the number of users or transactions would be far smaller than it is today. 

A new NPCI equivalent entity might do exactly that to the broader payments space and take it into areas we don't think they can. Having a second entity will also clarify NPCI's own position as just one among equals, hopefully without any special treatment. It may hopefully make the Govt think more carefully on announcing fee waivers without compensating the players involved, with the new players likely to argue their case more strongly.
9/14/20, 21:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: conflict of interest..
9/14/20, 21:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so is BHIM tho

I am also of the opinion that without GPay, PhonePe, UPI would not be where it is today.

But I also wonder if not for BHIM would it have encouraged the others to get in so seriously? UPI existed much before BHIM. But only after the BHIM push post demonitisation did others jump in with seriousness. In my view they were the catalyst.

The conflict is sure there and now that they have played the part...
9/14/20, 21:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Someone should be smart enough to that government can‚Äôt run Not-For-Profit  and Non-profitable enterprises beyond 12 months + shrinking market share = sale in N many months.

Of course this will never happen but unless a rule like this comes along, India will never really grow to its potential.

These subtle changes should be how good governance should be ushered in.

9/14/20, 22:15 - +65 9732 7516: üëçüèºBHIM was the MVP that got all banks to connect to UPI and solved all problems of the initial  sdk versions. Best way to solve product problems is to keep them near and solve them. It is because of wanting to make  BHIM work that NPCI folks put in a huge amount of effort in getting the initial teething issues resolved to create a runway for the private apps. Kudos to NPCI for the way they ran it.
9/14/20, 22:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yeah.. tho its just conflict of interest, for regulator to compete against licensees

UPI would be never it is today without Gpay, phonepe, Paytm.For profit organisations are behind the success of NPCI. Now NPCI needs to whatsapp pay for UPI to reach 1.5 billion a day. *So for profit organisation is the success mantra*. Allow more player to come in. NUE is not a social initiative to serve poor unprofitable section of society. If so then no one will apply. 

*View 71*
But the main reason quoted is systemic risk that NPCI runs.Single point of failure risk ...

*QUESTION* _what is risk of failure ? is NPCI bigger than SBI? *Then SBI CAN ALSO FAIL*_

*View 72*
Innovations at eco system level consumes significant time and effort from all participants. That‚Äôs why UPI took time to bloom. Private capital will drive innovation faster, but in India, especially with large Govt ownership, adoption to such innovations or alternatives takes time. SWIFT INDIA is a good example of an alternative to SFMS.

True. But network level risks impact the whole ecosystem and all players. Today RBI is the only alternate payment player with RTGS & NEFT. Availability risks and settlement risks would also be a concern.  But then is the current suggestion the answer? We will have to wait and see...
9/14/20, 22:35 - +65 9732 7516: Allow NPCI to be for profit. And define regulations to allow profitable business models to come up for target segments for financial inclusion.

The conflicts of interest argument mentioned does not go away with more players. It goes away with clear direction to follow. There are good learnings basis the growth and innovation that has happened in the last 4 years.Regarding efficiency argument define what is quality and keep the company accountable to it. 
There are examples in APAC where govts owned monopolies are efficient and profitable. 

Even India has examples if we move away from popular perception. 
On the other hand - 
There are examples of infrastructure sectors that have not fared too well on service levels or efficiency with too much of competition.
9/14/20, 22:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: View 71 assumes SBI is a 75+ year success story.
9/14/20, 22:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Indira Gandhi Bank nationalisation scheme is India‚Äôs greatest economic misadventure.
9/14/20, 22:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: For which it will pay for every year till 100% on demand banking license is given out
9/14/20, 22:45 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Completely agree with @6597327516 @919820398115. 

In addition would also say that that NPCI should not be ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù by the reigns of the govt. At some point of time it will start stifling innovation.

Making NPCI for profit also help them invest more on branding marketing and positioning. Will also help them get better talent. 

Other products like RuPay are neither aspirational nor a great consumer pull. 
Making NPCI more independent and for profit will help them build better on marketing. 

Lastly while i agree that UPI needs to ‚Äúalmost free‚Äù or incentivised to grow and scale further; at somepoint of time the viability of maintaining infra, growing product, and marketing - economics of UPI will not work for many incl NPCI.

Financial inclusion agenda cannot be furthered over the coffins of players who couldnt survive due to unviable cost structures

Imho, for corporates be it fintech, Pvt bank or MNC Banks end objective is Profitability, so the innovations where they would be involved will not be projects like Aadhar which would be for greater good of the masses. It is just about innovation in different areas- Pvt Banks or MNC Banks or fintechs have shown innovation in lot many niche products as well. Innovation for profitability or Innovation to facilitate nation building are perhaps the options and depending upon priorities one would chose one over the other.Areas where perhaps Private enterprise would continue do better in aspect of innovation would be Pharma, Health care and IT/ITES

*View 17*  CXO Consulting

My opinion differs here.. CDAC etc are efficient tech initiatives of gov....however "innovation" is something that needs to be carefully used...aadhar and the initiatives taken by NPCI are quite possibly result of the advisory they are getting from consulting firms .. u never know...and these concepts are btw already existing in most countries....not new concept at all...the much higher benchmarks is social security number in USA which is integrated with central database which extracts information from various gov verticals such as financial credibility, police records, mortgage data  etc

 I am not undermining contribution of gov in "implementing" but "innovation" is something that shud not be loosely used is my concern purely basis the content posted above

*View 22* CXO 
Have this tech possibly in mobiles wud have been more secure...I am not even sure if it does already exists...I mean it exists in form of apps..which need manual intervention to log in, add money, select payment beneficiary etc or qr code...how does this watch function..is it deriving data from mobile linked to it..

I really don't understand this concept.. wht convenience or better accessibility does it bring besides just being a concept accessible to few ..is thr any cutting edge tech involved in this..and how secure is this...

9/17/20, 20:09 - Vikas Business Phone: Asset tokenization is a term that is fairly common in block-chain lingua franca. Up until now, it was used to tokenize real estate or other pre-existing illiquid assets. 
To the best of our comprehension, the article talks about exploring the possibility of financial engineering in asset tokenization. 

As financial ecosystems evolved, they liquidized money that was otherwise stuck in real-estate and loans, etc. The author believes that this evolution can be achieved in asset tokenization as well; that a chain of events beyond initial asset creation and purchase can be achieved.

For instance, blockchain technology could give investors the ability to self-assemble bespoke investment products dynamically, specifying the assets, and creating tranches or other attributes best suited for their specific needs.
However, this transformation also requires a deep understanding of the types of investors that would buy tokenized assets.

It also requires a deep understanding of the types of investors that would buy tokenized assets. Investors are quite varied, from large to mid-sized institutions, mutual funds, pension funds, (multi) family offices, registered investment advisors, ultra-high net worth investors, and retail investors. Improving asset liquidity requires opening access to an asset to a broader spectrum of investors. The considerable potential that blockchain can bring to real asset financial products is best served first to institutional investors where they have the expertise to evaluate these new vehicles and co-create new financial products with this technology. As these new products mature, then retail investors would have more information to act on. 

Digitization platform companies need to have a deep understanding and appreciation of securities regulations and take a collaborative approach with regulators to address their concerns to create financial innovation successfully. Only a few digital securities fintech companies are beginning to show a critical understanding of the regulatory landscape, have asset expertise, and complementary proficiency across the investor ecosystem. 

The good news is that such ecosystems, although in their preliminary stage are here (examples are cited towards the end of the article) and financial engineering in asset tokenization, comparable in sofistication to traditional ecosystems, has become a real, achievable milestone.

9/18/20, 18:16 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 93*

_The former president and CEO of Bank Leumi,_
_the answer to today's quiz is:_

*Rakefet Russak-Aminoach (IsraelüáÆüá±)*

Rakefet Russak-Aminoach started her career as the personal assistant to Bank Leumi‚Äôs then-deputy CEO Galia Maor (later known as Israel‚Äôs Iron Lady of banking). 

In May 2012, she took up job of Leumi's CEO and endured a rough first few years. In 2015, 2016 and 2018, Russak-Aminoach was listed in Fortune's *100 Most Powerful Women in Business* list. She was ranked 43rd in the international list in 2018.

For Rakefet Russak-Aminoach, part of being a good leader is knowing when to leave. She says, no chief executive _"should sit in their chair for dozens of years."_ It was partly for that reason that she announced she was leaving Leumi in June 2019 and giving up her prominent role as one of the world's only female bank CEOs.

On Tuesday, Team8, a Tel Aviv- and New York-based venture group backed by Microsoft, Walmart, Barclays, and Moodys, announced that Russak-Aminoach will be one of the leaders of its new arm, Team8 Fintech.

9/18/20, 19:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: companies like paytm or paypal dont encourage any association with competitors. wonder if apple or google would one day say.. "no competing apps" üòÖ
9/18/20, 19:32 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: We had our app removed once for what we thought was a frivolous reason. It was a nightmare for a few hours. But there was indeed a 'policy violation' something to do with the specs of the app icon. What we understood was:

1. It's an automated process. Not possible to manually audit the scale
2. There apparently is a white listing process which is very select but provides better services and avoids such surprises
3. Otherwise, there is no option but to wait for the online support to help. We were lucky as we had an account manager and other contacts to guide us

So not sure if it's Google acting cute or PayTm converting this to a PR opportunity üòÄ
9/18/20, 19:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: business model reviews maybe be manually audited or based on reports.. can you really automate that efficiently?
9/18/20, 19:39 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: If an app is redirecting / providing a link to a Real Money Gaming or gambling website it can be efficiently monitored...
9/18/20, 19:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yes. as long as its a straight up gaming site. so, i feel decision to mark Paytm First Games as a gambling site might have been done by manual review, and then the others would have gotten affected for linking to it..
9/18/20, 19:58 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on *PAYTM being pulled down from GOOGLE App Store*_ 

*View 2*  _FOUNDER_ 
In India 99% of the app are running on Google App Store. It‚Äôs an unilateral decision. Many Start-up are getting bullied by this company. *Google can do this to Jio too*

Is scratch card based cash back called gambling ?  

Is paying someone or 
shopkeeper called gambling ? 

*Does government, RBI  and Indian Bankers understand risk Google can pose to all the banking apps. They can take a unilateral decision and bring down the banking app by citing some clause*. 

*View 3* Founder 

High time that INDIA has its *own App Store working across all platforms/ devices*.

9/18/20, 20:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Really?
9/18/20, 20:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: How is it applicable in India?
9/18/20, 20:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: well. to be fair, if not for that, FB would have OWNED Indian internet economy by now.

We need *NUE* for GOOGLE type service and not for NPCI. Risk of blacklisting al Indian companies is very Big. Paytm app is back on playstore
9/18/20, 20:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: So the reverse bundling is ok?
9/18/20, 20:17 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Arey, Ambani can change legislations, bring new law, where Jio is the new neutral üòâüòÉ
9/18/20, 20:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Like rather than going down the stack
9/18/20, 20:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Going up the stack is not infringement of the same laws?
9/18/20, 20:20 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Why not both?
9/18/20, 20:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: bit confused by what u mean.. but Jio cant do what I said and cant block google due to this reason.. atleast theoretically..
9/18/20, 20:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: mostly because telecom is a regulated business.. app store is not..
9/18/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What is net neutrality?
9/18/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The ability of one player to not be able to influence other parts of Internet infrastructure to gain favourable terms
9/18/20, 20:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is applicable to hardware and software both
9/18/20, 20:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its not
9/18/20, 20:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: there is no law that defines what app cann be banned or approved on a device
9/18/20, 20:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: No no it‚Äôs not about banning or approving
9/18/20, 20:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: so, manufacturer can do what he pleases
9/18/20, 20:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs a very different thing
9/18/20, 20:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: but, telecom/internet operator cannot block sites as he wishes
9/18/20, 20:24 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: I am not defending Google. But what I am asking is if it's policy based... What's wrong?

And about start-ups. I think it's a mutually beneficial arrangement where Google gets more apps on the store and the publishers get access to their huge number of customers. In this age, if they really mess around, sooner later new ecosystems will develop
9/18/20, 20:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: in apple context
9/18/20, 20:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: same for play store or app store.. there is currenntly no law governing how they should allow or ban apps on there.. its to their discretion and internal policy..
9/18/20, 20:25 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: This message was deleted

9/18/20, 20:59 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Video 041_ : *Plan B - Is there an alternative to economic growth?*

An increase in the GDP rate of a country invariably requires growth in production and consumption. Currently, the competition and struggle for a growing economy and GDP is perpetual and does not project any ceiling to this growth model.

We have adopted an extremely technocentric approach to the environmental implications of economic growth. However, there is scientific evidence which explains why this 'dekh lenge' attitude won't work.

*Q1* Digital Banking initiative is all App dependent. App  operating system is controlled around the world by only ONE company. Big boss of the banks is not regulators but it is the Google. *They can just switch off any bank app anytime* Do banks and regulators around the world understand the *COUNTRY LEVEL RISK* because of monopolistic powers Google in the whole app ecosystem 

*Q2* can your country develop alternative to Google and debundle the *Phone* üì± 
with *Operating system* and *Playstore* 

India has _Aadhar identity platform, UPI platform_ then why can‚Äôt India‚Äôs develop its *own App Store* working across all platforms/ devices. 

*Q3* Google Algorithm can shut any start-up. 

Big companies like *Paytm* can get the their app back function within couple of hours. But small start-up just can‚Äôt. How can we remove this dependency of *start-up ecosystem*

9/19/20, 15:15 - +91 90233 89243: When we used to do the wallets, the beta testing was not dependent on play store, but we had our own portal where users can go and download the apk and test. The same thing can be replicated for a production ready app as well. Though thats just a very small releif from the overall monopoly of  companies operating app stores.
9/19/20, 15:39 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
9/19/20, 18:38 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: In fact it‚Äôs even worse in case of Apple because TestFlight is also controlled by Apple though they do not impose an approval process for TestFlight.

This duopoly power is similar to the earlier days when internet root servers were all in the USA and it was possible for the US to technically shut down the internet. 

The duopoly power should be viewed at two different levels -  discrimination at policy level (eg banning Paytm), and discrimination at country level.
9/19/20, 18:40 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Eg some country may have legalized form of gambling and it‚Äôs ok to have gambling apps available in the appstore for that country. Who then is google to decide if gambling apps should be allowed. Because now AppStore and playstore reach and impact should be governed independent of country level considerations.
9/19/20, 18:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: that brings a thought.. will US sanctions apply to app stores?
9/19/20, 18:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if its legal, google allows it.. you have plenty gambling apps in the UK, but only for licensed companies.

9/19/20, 18:46 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: I used gambling just as an example. Some country may want to do the reverse - ban online gambling.
9/19/20, 18:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: of course. they usually go inline with local laws.
9/19/20, 18:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: adult content, gambling, etc.
9/19/20, 18:49 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Right
9/19/20, 18:50 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: One can even argue that what if a bank like say SBI or ICICI was to give a scratch card cash reward within their app. Would google ban the bank‚Äôs app?
9/19/20, 18:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: why not?
9/19/20, 18:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: does SBI allow you to start an account and do business that it doesnt seem fit?
9/19/20, 18:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: like crypto, for eg.
9/19/20, 18:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: despite no legal ban on it, banks suspend and close accounts at their whimcy
9/19/20, 18:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: dont they?
9/19/20, 18:52 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: It does bring in the bigger question of what is considered as game of chance and whether it‚Äôs a game at all
9/19/20, 18:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: more than just game or gambling, this has to do with how much of a hitler a company can be, on its own platform!
9/19/20, 18:55 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: Doesn't Google pay itself have scratch card based rewards?

9/19/20, 18:55 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: If I have a brick and mortar store, I decide what to stock and sell. But it cannot be against the law of the land... I think it's very similar in this case

9/20/20, 11:27 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Gen Z Talent Show 4.0*

_An undergraduate says the recent issue between *Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Google* reminds him of a public war between *Steve Jobs and Adobe*. He shares these insights from his latest read *Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson*_ )

Jobs's vision that your computer could become your digital hub went back to a technology called *FireWire*,which Apple developed in the early 1990s.It was a high speed serial port that moved digital files such as video from one device to another.Japanese camcorder makers adopted it,and Jobs decided to include it on the updated versions of the iMac that came out in October 1999.He began to see that FireWire could be part of a system that moved video from cameras onto a computer, where it could be edited and distributed.

To make this work,the iMac needed to have great video editing software.So Jobs went to his old friends at Adobe,the digital graphics company,and asked them to make a new Mac version of Adobe Premiere,which was popular on Windows computers. *Adobe's executives stunned Jobs by flatly turning him down*.The Macintosh, they said,had too few users to make it worthwhile.Jobs was furious and felt betrayed. "I put Adobe on the map,and they screwed me,"he later claimed.Adobe made matters even worse when it also didn't write it's other popular programs,such as Photoshop,for the Mac OSX,even though the Macintosh was popular among designers and other creative people who used those applications.

*Jobs never forgave Adobe,and a decade later he got into a public war with the company by not permitting Adobe Flash to run on the iPad*.He took away a valuable lesson that reinforced his desire for end-to-end control of all key elements of a system:"My Primary insight when we were screwed by Adobe in 1999 was that *we shouldn't get into any business where we didn't control both the hardware and the software,otherwise we'd get our head handed to us*."

So starting in 1999 Apple began to produce application software for the Mac,with a focus on people at the intersection of art and technology.These included *Final Cut Pro*,for editing digital video; *iMovie*, which was a simpler consumer version; *iDVD*,for burning video or music onto a disc; *iPhoto*,to compete with Adobe Photoshop; *Garage-Band*, for creating and mixing music; *iTunes*,for managing your songs;and the *iTunes Store*,for buying songs.


_*Make In India* is all about nurturing the Gen Z talent and encouraging their *bootstrap ventures & ideas*_ üí°

9/20/20, 17:13 - Fintech Aayush NnR: VSS is astute, he generally never publicly makes irreparable comments, including against Google
9/20/20, 17:15 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Fully agree with this. If you talk to the Public bodies in India, you realise how naive and mis informed they are about data protection and privacy and how dotish is their vision about this. They dont realise that what they are already sitting on is no less than a ticking time bomb of data. I much rather nit share anything with Govt
9/20/20, 17:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And the reason is simple for this, private companies, no matter how large can be questioned in courts, governments can‚Äôt, especially in developing countries.

9/21/20, 21:19 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: UPI IDs are easy to create and looks like they can be lost equally easily too!
9/21/20, 21:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Sometimes everyapp creating its own id when you start using, appears more like bane than boon. You end up not remembering all those trails you create. Almost feel its a flaw by design
9/21/20, 21:26 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: It may feel like that at times, but I still see the ability to create UPI ids as needed as a good feature. But shutting down a @suffix is a bit like an email provider changing their domain name. @gmail => @alphabet anyone?
9/21/20, 21:32 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: True that. Shutting down is too much. 

I agree flexibility of creation is great. But what i am trying to say by the same example of an email client is this:
Upi apps should work like a container like outlook. If i have a UPI id like abc@upi then in any existing upi container i should be able to use it without having a necessarily create a new one by the container. If i need a new one apart from using the outlook container i can always do newabc@outlookupi
9/21/20, 21:34 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Agree with that. Just because it is possible to create does not mean that every app should create one.

9/21/20, 22:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I think this has to do with revenue
Split. The app creating the upi id is the ‚Äúissuer‚Äù..

9/21/20, 22:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. In premium.
9/21/20, 22:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: U mean non-gmail.com domain name, right?
9/21/20, 22:22 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I don't mean gsuite ids .. you can create a google account using your corporate id (to use all the services that they offer)
9/21/20, 22:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Kinda possible. Also one can use outlook without an outlook email id. I see upi apps as clients. Technically service is provided by NPCi
9/21/20, 22:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Outlook u can. Gmail u cant, I think
9/21/20, 22:24 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: <Media omitted>
9/21/20, 22:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And UPI apps are like Visa / MC members. Arnt they?
9/21/20, 22:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This doesnt give u access to gmail services. U can only use the gmail app as a mail client for non-gmail email ids. It has nothing to do with gmail or google platform
9/21/20, 22:25 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You have both issuers & acquirers. App creating id is issuer. App doing transaction, is acquirer.
9/21/20, 22:25 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I would rather think of using an hdfc card on an icici edc
9/21/20, 22:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No. Thats different analogy.
9/21/20, 22:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: U dont create an id for each use? They only create id on each sign up!
9/21/20, 22:27 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Hard to find a befitting analogy :)
9/21/20, 22:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. Opening new app = opening a new bank account
9/21/20, 22:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 22:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I mean, Will hdfc allow u to use ur icici card WITH HDFC AC, because u already had icici card before opening hdfc ac?
9/21/20, 22:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They wont. Because any revenue they get from u using a card, they get only from card issued by them
9/21/20, 22:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 22:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Same for upi handle. Issuer revenue split only issuer gets.
9/21/20, 22:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Imaging you sign up for a new web service and it creates a new email id for you, instead of using your existing email id to create an account for you.
9/21/20, 22:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: imagine
9/21/20, 22:30 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: While doing banking, some concepts of upi came from the email world; so why stick to banking issuer/acquirer logic
9/21/20, 22:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You are not signing up for a new web service. You are signing up for a new email service but want to use ur old email address?
9/21/20, 22:30 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Which can still happen on the backend without having to necessarily create a new handle
9/21/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You can still use ur old upi handle on any non-payment app
9/21/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 22:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Only payment apps that you sign up for create new upi handles

Not all apps which accept UPI need u to create a new one
9/21/20, 22:32 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: maybe the context has drifted a bit .... there are third party apps (which are not banks) which create their own UPI ids and none of them let you enter an existing UPI id.
9/21/20, 22:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: They are PAYMENT APPS!
9/21/20, 22:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not just any apps
9/21/20, 22:32 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: sure ... but all the UPI ids point to the same account at a bank.
9/21/20, 22:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: How can you do that? 

Issuer is decided based on upi id
9/21/20, 22:33 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Absolutely. And thats why dont need to mandate creating a new handle.
9/21/20, 22:33 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: the outlook and gmail client analogy is more appropriate in that light
9/21/20, 22:33 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Just like how issuer of a card is identified from card number, issuer of upi id is identified from upi handle
9/21/20, 22:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 22:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Over simplification. Then, how can u decide who the issuer revenue goes to?
9/21/20, 22:35 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: This is a brand new protocol - with no legacy from the past. UserAgent like model on who generates the request
9/21/20, 22:35 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The app that on boards the user can still be the issues without mandating a new handle. The tx info trail can explicitly highlight that info?
9/21/20, 22:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Generate request is acquirer side. Got nothing to do with issuer.
9/21/20, 22:36 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: not really ... a majority (if not most) of all UPI payments are push payments, initiated by the "issuer"'s app
9/21/20, 22:36 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: the old card analogy is not really valid here
9/21/20, 22:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Where does the revenue come from?
9/21/20, 22:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Is there even a comparable fee for push payments? Arnt the fees mostly applicable for pull payments?
9/21/20, 22:40 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: we are talking about identifying parties to the transaction - which it definitely lets you do
9/21/20, 22:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, lets say I have only 1 upi id
9/21/20, 22:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: To which app will a pull request be sent?
9/21/20, 22:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It will be sent to the app whocj created it. Multiple apps cannot be sent the same request?
9/21/20, 22:42 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Then, who gets issuer revenue? That app!
9/21/20, 22:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: For eg
I have panicker@upi which I creates on bhim

U wany xyz app also to use that id to identify me

Now, am using it on say irctc

I get notification on bhim. I do the transaction.

Xyz app gets no revenue!
9/21/20, 22:43 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: The phone will see two (or more installed) apps and ask which one you want to use when an UPI intent is received. More power to you üôÇ
9/21/20, 22:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Wishful thinking 

How will NPCI know where to send request?
9/21/20, 22:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: UPI handle serves the same purpose as BIN
9/21/20, 22:58 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 22:59 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: As I said in my earlier comment I think the ability to create any number of UPI ids for an account is a good feature. The demise of the @pockets id is no big deal, but still a sign of the new world of UPI where a banking identifier can just disappear. This.is.a.good.thing. UPI is a completely new layer over banks and is not (and should not be) constrained by the traditional structure of payment services or the 4-party model. There will be UPI ids galore and some handles will eventually become the gmails and outlooks of the world while others go the way of yahoo or rediffmail
9/21/20, 22:59 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: It is not wishful thinking. It depends on the kind of payment Integration. One can 'pull money' if the customers fill in a UPI id. It is also possible to have an integration where when a customer chooses UPI as a payment option... All the UPI apps 'listen' and the user gets to choose the app she wants to pay from. Technically it will be a push payment and not pull
9/21/20, 23:02 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: A pull or push does not matter. It depends in whether it is P2M or P2P. Economics of remitter bank, bene bank, remitter psp and bene psp and npci are defined depending on P2M / P2P and also the ticket size. Pull or push does not matter
9/21/20, 23:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If thats the case, isnt it cleaner to just allow user to decide which upi id he wants to use? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/21/20, 23:04 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Ergo!
9/21/20, 23:04 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: The user always decides which id to use
9/21/20, 23:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: There is no continuous ambiguity of choosing from multiple apps, at every single time
9/21/20, 23:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I would hate to get 10 notifications AND smss on my phone for each transaction I attempt
9/21/20, 23:06 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Use only one id
9/21/20, 23:07 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 1 id on multiple apps = multiple notifications for each time I use that id
9/21/20, 23:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You said all apps listen = all appa notify = Multiple notifications for 1 transaction
9/21/20, 23:09 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: One id is linked to only one PSP. Not multiple. Therefore there is no multiple notification from multiple apps
9/21/20, 23:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Then, how can other payment apps use that id? 

What do they get from that? üßê
9/21/20, 23:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 23:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: The issue is again the issuer side revenue
9/21/20, 23:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If nobody wants any revenue, all these hypothetical situations work just fine
9/21/20, 23:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And upi id could be restricted to the bank where U have the account
9/21/20, 23:13 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: No
9/21/20, 23:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Why not?
9/21/20, 23:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 23:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/21/20, 23:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If u want only 1 id per bank account, default option should be the bank where u hold account
9/21/20, 23:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: You obviously cant say, I am paytm/phonepe/googlepay, I created this users first UPI id, now everyone use my upi id üòÇ
9/21/20, 23:18 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: I believe the whole idea behind UPI is loose coupling. 
Any debit id, any credit id, any app. The only thing common is the npci common library to take your authentication in
9/21/20, 23:19 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: The user is free to use the PSP / PSPs she likes and create an is provided by the PSP. And link whichever bank account/s to the id/s...
9/21/20, 23:19 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: This message was deleted
9/21/20, 23:20 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: It's not separate notifications... It's akin to asking do you want to use Google docs or Microsoft word to open the file
9/21/20, 23:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Like I said, there is no revenue share applicable everytime u edit a doc..
9/21/20, 23:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, its not relevant
9/21/20, 23:21 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: If you have both installed
9/21/20, 23:21 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Comparing apples & oranges
9/21/20, 23:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üëÜüèº
9/21/20, 23:34 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: You need to look at the P2P and P2M commercials... The revenues are very clearly defined and accordingly the players decide where to focus and how to charge. There is no hypothetical situation here. A Payer PSP for example is never out of pocket in any transaction (at a txn level). A Remitter Bank in a P2P txn might incur charges but may have the ability to recover from the customer

EMI moratorium appears to be just a forced way to ease out things during this pandemic period whereas in reality it is not being channeled into a proper and systematic approach to lessen the loan burden.

Technically if one looks at it, the banks 3 months loan business got done without any payout. If your EMI is Rs 1 lakh a month ‚Äì 3 month‚Äôs no EMI ( not free) at 8%. Which means the bank just disbursed you a PL without you even wanting at 8%. They just back-ended it by 3 months ‚Äì people think it‚Äôs free of cost but it is not. And if any default will be deferred over a 10-15 year period and not at one shot. So am I right to assume that the banks‚Äô loan book just got a small 3-month auto disbursement. So effectively banks just gave a PL by default to all their borrowers without any DSA payout.

9/25/20, 17:27 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: Coke / Pepsi / Unilever
9/25/20, 17:37 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: Good try

9/25/20, 18:07 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 94*


_The world's *3 Worst Offenders for Plastic Pollution*, as of 2020, are as follows:_
(Figures in parenthesis indicate metric tonnes of plastic packaging produced annually)

*No.1*
Coca-Colaüá∫üá∏ (2.9 million)

*No.2*
Pepsicoüá∫üá∏ (2.3 million)

*No.3*
Nestl√©üá®üá≠ (1.7 million)


Since plastic production took off in 1950s, it has skyrocketed to 448 million tonnes by 2015. From this just 9% of all plastic has been recycled, while 12% has been incinerated and *79% has ended up in landfills or the natural environment.*

The Changing Markets Foundation has released a new report naming and shaming the world's worst plastic waste offenders. Entitled "*Talking Trash: The Corporate Playbook of False Solutions*", the report states that the companies involved are actively taking steps to obstruct and undermine legislative solutions aimed at tackling an unprecedented global plastic waste crisis. Industry tactics to *distract, delay and derail legislation* are being used by corporations and industry associations in countries around the world. 

Recommendations for companies in the report include "Commitment to meaningful measures that would lead to a significant reduction in single-use plastics and other single-use materials. These measures need to be specific, measurable, time-bound and independently verified, and should include support for reuse, redesign of products and effective recycling."
9/25/20, 18:08 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: I'm surprised by Nestle.  Will read up more on this.
9/25/20, 18:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: Congratulations you got all answers correct !!üëç
9/25/20, 18:29 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç

9/25/20, 18:30 - Vikas Business Phone: üëç
9/25/20, 18:42 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: A whopping 98% of¬†Nestl√©‚Äôs products are sold in single-use packaging... 

Yet I would still have expected Unilever to be a large pollutant sheerly driven by the volume of products they sell in plastic packaging globally.
9/25/20, 19:17 - +91 90233 89243: If I remember correctly there was even a ban on nestle products, not sure of the teason

_An undergraduate shared these insights on BRAZIL üáßüá∑ from his latest read *Breakout Nations*_ )

When we say that *India* is an emerging market, it can either be the *next Brazil* or it can be the *next China*

Brazil is a country that has always been emerging. Each of Brazil's elected Presidents since 1980 came in with a different version of the same plan- _freeze prices and introduce a new currency_, something that happened *five times in a decade*. In 1994, the inflation in Brazil touched 2100% and Brazil ended this nightmare with the introduction of the 'Real'. However, Brazil has battled inflation ever since by maintaining high interest rates,which has attracted a surge of foreign money. This explains why the Brazilian Real is so expensive compared to most currencies, dampening it's exports.

Exports could have been used as an instrument of Brazil's growth as the market value of Brazil's state owned oil giant, *Petrobras* reached more than *$300B* in 2008. Interestingly,the total value of Turkey's stock market in the same year was less than $200B. 

The *starking similarities between India and Brazil* should concern the Indian govt as Brazil had offered the world's most generous welfare program- *Bolsa Familia Income Supports* until the Indian *MGNREGA* got that tag in 2005. 

_If you think *CXO title* is precondition to be a  thought leader then please start interacting with *Gen Z* as  they will surprise you with talent and depth. Lets encourage and start investing in  their *bootstrap ventures & ideas*_ üí°

9/30/20, 15:54 - Vikas Business Phone: Black box means? Didn't get u
9/30/20, 15:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: for insurance.. its a box u fix on ur car, to monitor ur driving style..
so, innsurance schemes with black box, will have lower premium...

9/30/20, 15:55 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: isnt that what u meant when u said "track ur driving"?
9/30/20, 15:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Black box insurance (also known as telematics insurance) is having a small black box fitted to your car that is used to gather the following information:
The time of day or night you drive
The speed you drive at on different sorts of road
If you brake or accelerate sharply
If you take breaks on long journeys
Your motorway miles
Your total mileage
This information is then used to work out how safely you drive.

9/30/20, 17:34 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Some cos ask you to install a mobile app to track your driving. The app will track kms, driving speed, hard braking etc. Based on the driving habit it recalculates premium every month. 

If you drive well these tracking apps can be very beneficial. It does throw up the question of privacy because they track all your trips and over time this information could become valuable enough to be shared with advertisers. 

Just like with any other technology, there needs to be a strong governance framework on the usage of customer data.
9/30/20, 17:34 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: If anyone has not seen the Social Dilemma - highly recommend it. Nothing new which us tech folks did not know but it is def a well produced documentary.
9/30/20, 17:36 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: The apps if well engineered, can do away with having to install a device as they can detect or give you options to inform the app whether you are driving or taking a taxi or using transit.
9/30/20, 17:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: ah. dint know they use mobile apps.. thats a more cost efficient method, but more reliant on the customer..
9/30/20, 18:08 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Yes it works best if there is incentive to customer like discount on premium otherwise it won‚Äôt be effective or customer may deny location access or data access to the app at will

10/1/20, 09:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But what it really means, as UPI did 1.8 Transactions or 10% growth over last month, when the entire economy is in doldrums still, the scope of the product is huge.
10/1/20, 09:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Like the product fails 1/3 times and yet it does 1.8 Billion transactions and grows double digit month on month
10/1/20, 09:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Also hearing most of the failure is SBI related from some quarters.
10/1/20, 09:36 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I dont think you can consider 65% aggregate and consider it as the overall success rate.
10/1/20, 09:36 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Since this also includes users just experimenting and may not always have an intent to pay
10/1/20, 09:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs a very large number
10/1/20, 09:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: ~12% failure is definitely an area to work on
10/1/20, 09:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: On a pretty well penetrated product
10/1/20, 09:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Well penetrated is a perception
10/1/20, 09:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I don‚Äôt know unique user count so can‚Äôt exactly say
10/1/20, 09:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Well penetrated for its SAM not TAM
10/1/20, 09:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: We are in a country where people using upi dont know what is upi or what their upi id is
10/1/20, 09:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Even a very well penetrated card funnel (which has been there for decades) you see 20-25%+ drops depending on the use case
10/1/20, 09:40 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: 12% is the real concern. My sense is the rest 35% will gradually reduce with the ecosystem growth. Not to say user experience cannot be improved
10/1/20, 09:40 - AirTel Vivek Singh Airtel payments bank Nn: The key difference between UPi and other products like card, netbanking etc is in the aditional multi factors like app push , intent calls etc.. which are highly user and PSP dependent
10/1/20, 09:40 - Fintech Aayush NnR: My sense is that it will gradually increase
10/1/20, 09:41 - AirTel Vivek Singh Airtel payments bank Nn: 12% has 11% in business deckines like low balance incorrect inputs like mpin etc
10/1/20, 09:41 - AirTel Vivek Singh Airtel payments bank Nn: Tech decline is 1% only
10/1/20, 09:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is how product grows, right?
The user should feel magic, not product flow. That‚Äôs not his job.
10/1/20, 09:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Cannot happen in isolation. If i come a merchant page where i dont know what my upi id is it wont work
10/1/20, 09:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Unless npci says that everything will be phone number driven
10/1/20, 09:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I agree products can innovate
10/1/20, 09:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And make the experience seamless
10/1/20, 09:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hoga
10/1/20, 09:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Jai Jio
10/1/20, 09:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: + others who want to take market share from incumbents
10/1/20, 09:44 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Infact google pay and phonpe are the 2 guys who have really worked on ecosystem growth
10/1/20, 09:44 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: With clear innovation
10/1/20, 09:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Absolutely they have, kudos to them, hats off
10/1/20, 09:44 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Fully agree
10/1/20, 09:45 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Honestly i feel that 1% bank tech failure for payment system is also very high
10/1/20, 09:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It is
10/1/20, 09:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Financial products should be at 99.5% success rates
10/1/20, 09:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I don‚Äôt think people even accept anything less than 97% failure up front
10/1/20, 09:46 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Anything less than Six sigma for payments product is low nevertheless
10/1/20, 09:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: But i guess the other funnel related to user experience specially on bank apps doing upi is a big area crying for improvement
10/1/20, 09:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Dil hai choota sa, chooti is asha.

65% - 95% pe aajaye, clearly India will have opportunity to change.

Was very surprised by this hence brought it up.
10/1/20, 09:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I laugh everything when banks ask consumers whats your VPA. Who understand VPA?
10/1/20, 09:47 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: *everytime
10/1/20, 09:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: My neighbour 60 years old who is sbi cust was trying to use yono called me because the options said pay to a vpa! We was like i want to do upi but dont know what a vpa is
10/1/20, 09:50 - AirTel Vivek Singh Airtel payments bank Nn: Npci is coming with new concept of 8-12 digit unique id to replayVPA

10/1/20, 09:51 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I have spoken to the npci team about it, and the way its approached i feel its gonna be another huge hiccup. Almost feels like mmid where no one ever knew what it was
10/1/20, 09:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Who understands all this jargon?
10/1/20, 09:52 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sir aur kitne digits and IDs yaad rakhein hum apne zindagi mein?
10/1/20, 09:52 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Totally. If banks could just shamelessly copy ui from some good products they would be better off
10/1/20, 09:52 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Exactly
10/1/20, 09:53 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Bas ek aur üòú

10/1/20, 10:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: People very close to ground are saying that a lot of banks want UPI to fail because it went from being a profit centre to cost centre and from customer retention to customer churning.
10/1/20, 10:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Even more reasons why Dinosaurs must die ü¶ñ ‚òÑÔ∏è
10/1/20, 10:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeh 1947 ke khayalat abhi bhi chal rahein hai yahaan
10/1/20, 10:05 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: True. Since the guidelines for providing the support is not clear. Even a many times, when we are trying to use PayTM for UPI patents it fails for 3-4 times at bank end.
10/1/20, 10:06 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: No one  can blame bank . Bcoz they don‚Äôt care and they don‚Äôt answer for this errors since you are not their customer and PayTM or any other app can not answer since the error is at other end.üòÇ
10/1/20, 10:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Dekho mera desh, financially, jal raha hai.
10/1/20, 10:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Banking licenses have to open up, whether we like it or not
10/1/20, 10:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The number of businesses who will die and the NPAs that will happen in banking next year will be India‚Äôs biggest in history

10/1/20, 10:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: That‚Äôs the beginning of the end for dinosaurs whenever it happens, whether under pressure or under growth or because someone was given gratuity faster.

10/1/20, 10:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Stock market will rule
10/1/20, 10:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I mean heavy weights will become heavier weights
10/1/20, 10:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: K shape recovery as you may have heard
10/1/20, 10:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But what people aren‚Äôt calculating is in a K shape recovery risk mitigation methods go for a toss and therefore your losses for a bank which gives out loans will be far higher than its gains
10/1/20, 10:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I am guessing but a lot more mergers or shut down in banking is expected, and quite possibly next year itself. Because government can‚Äôt wait for this to happen in 2023 or later, 2024 is an election year. So let‚Äôs see.
10/1/20, 10:29 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: This will be risky K recovery mode. Let‚Äôs hope for the best.

_*Partner of large VC/PE form on ‚ÄúIs VC legal Ponzi?‚Äù post says*_ 
Since this is a an informal yet serious forum, thought will put out my point of view here.
With no offense meant - i humbly *disagree* with the VC being considered legal Ponzi statement.  Tech has been a savior in this pandemic and definitely the way forward.  And the driver of the tech, innovation and development has been through VC investments.  of course, there are losses and high loss ratios but then its the power law that makes the model successful :)

_*Fintech Founders On the post ‚ÄúInsurance companies tracking your driving‚Äù*_

do they have black boxes in India now? for insurance.. its a box u fix on ur car, to monitor ur driving style..so, innsurance schemes with black box, will have lower premium...
isnt that what u meant when u said "track ur driving"?

*View 3*
Black box insurance (also known as telematics insurance) is having a small black box fitted to your car that is used to gather the following information:
The time of day or night you drive
The speed you drive at on different sorts of road
If you brake or accelerate sharply
If you take breaks on long journeys
Your motorway miles
Your total mileage
This information is then used to work out how safely you drive.
https://www.insurethebox.com/young-drivers-insurance

*View 5*
Some cos ask you to install a mobile app to track your driving. The app will track kms, driving speed, hard braking etc. Based on the driving habit it recalculates premium every month. 

If you drive well these tracking apps can be very beneficial. It does throw up the question of privacy because they track all your trips and over time this information could become valuable enough to be shared with advertisers. 

Just like with any other technology, there needs to be a strong governance framework on the usage of customer data.
If anyone has not seen the Social Dilemma - highly recommend it. Nothing new which us tech folks did not know but it is def a well produced documentary.

*Response*
ah. dint know they use mobile apps.. thats a more cost efficient method, but more reliant on the customer..

10/2/20, 00:05 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on cooperatives banker shares an interaction on *INTEROPERABILITY* with its  customer_

*Why are wallets cannot be debited for any purchases using Google pay*

My per month earning is  Rs 35,000. I allocate funds as under:

Fixed Deposit - Rs 10,000 
Saving account - 14000 
Cash - 6000
Wallet(paytm/ phone Pe)- 5000

I had kept Rs 5000 in wallet  for watching movie, buying burger üçî, ordering pizza, paying vegetable and fish üê† etc  

These days whenever we buy burger or pizza, the POS generate QR code but I *cannot* pay using wallets like Phone Pe or Paytm.  The person says I accept only Google Pay and am forced to debit my bank account. 

Why can‚Äôt I Debit my wallet while using Gpay ? Why only bank account is allowed. It‚Äôs my money and how can a shopkeeper deny accepting payment thru wallets.
10/2/20, 00:14 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Shopkeeper can deny because he does not have the ability to accept the payment. It's an open loop payments system (UPI) vs. a closed loop system. The shopkeeper can accept money from a PayTm wallet only if PayTM has done that merchant acquisition and can therefore settle the payment to the merchants account
10/2/20, 00:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Here it's not decision by shopkeeper.. It's Google pay which is denying access to wallets
10/2/20, 01:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because all money is not created equal
10/2/20, 01:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Here the decider is UPI and not Google Pay
10/2/20, 01:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Money from wallet and money from account are treated different because source of money doesn‚Äôt need an intermediation.
10/2/20, 01:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: How do you gain by funneling money from your bank account to wallet app to shop keeper? Why should this happen? Is this cheaper? Is this faster? Is this better?
10/2/20, 01:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Or should I do it because your valuation is $ 10 Billion?
10/2/20, 01:49 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What‚Äôs the ideal supply chain of money?
You imagine and it gets transferred from account A to account B.

What‚Äôs the second best option?
Single fastest cheaper surest universal mediator.
10/2/20, 01:51 - Fintech Aayush NnR: There is another very interesting insight on Apple and Google intermediation on the App Store side of things - Find out what‚Äôs China‚Äôs take rate via Chinese App Stores + Government App Stores.

Whether App Store A or B or C make money, I don‚Äôt care, what I care about is total cost of safe mediation.
10/2/20, 01:53 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Lots of players are going to make noise but its essentially a valuation saving game at this point. Please innovate on products rather than pointing out arbitrary loopholes and gaining valuation via legal structures.
10/2/20, 01:54 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Money ultimately doesn‚Äôt belong to a wallet, money belongs to a bank, so either make wallet a bank or bank a wallet or both and strive towards this outcome, while innovating on product side of things.
10/2/20, 07:37 - +91 90233 89243: I am operating one of my bank accounts as a wallet.

10/2/20, 11:57 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Notification - Dangerous permission to give to company like Jio.
10/2/20, 12:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Well look at the brighter side - If you are Jio user they already have your location.
10/2/20, 12:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Which is what? 40% of all Internets users in India now? Or is it 50%?
10/2/20, 12:01 - +91 90233 89243: You can revoke it later, dont know if app continues to work after that üòâ
10/2/20, 12:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Not keeping up with CMS / RMS @919920018403. What‚Äôs the current number?
10/2/20, 12:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Come on, won‚Äôt work.
10/2/20, 12:02 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Location yes. But notification means all the financial transactions. Messages. Emails.
10/2/20, 12:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Again Jio is reading your sms
10/2/20, 12:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And all your financial transactions
10/2/20, 12:03 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Good question. Will find latest details. Kotak has last week raised issues on Jio nos.
10/2/20, 12:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Notifications shouldn‚Äôt mean Email.
10/2/20, 12:03 - Fintech Aayush NnR: What issue? RMS/CMS ratio?
10/2/20, 12:04 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: The inactive numbers are nearly 20%
10/2/20, 12:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hahaha
10/2/20, 12:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Come on, that‚Äôs going to be normal if your landing price was negative at retail or relatively free for end user
10/2/20, 12:05 - +91 90233 89243: Reading your sms permission is I guess different from receiving notifications permission, the above seems to be latter?
10/2/20, 12:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This message was deleted
10/2/20, 12:05 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Makes a difference if the recent investors have invested x dollars per user üôà
10/2/20, 12:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It just means their current revenue per user is better than what‚Äôs perceived but their actual active customer base is lower.
10/2/20, 12:06 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Actually that‚Äôs a very valid point.
10/2/20, 12:06 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: I think it‚Äôs same.
10/2/20, 12:08 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: At least earlier both permissions used to be separate. Not clued in on the latest
10/2/20, 12:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Having said that, anybody who knows anything about Indian telecom would don this check
10/2/20, 12:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hence my point earlier
10/2/20, 12:09 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is a basic check to see quality of acquisition
10/2/20, 12:21 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: I am a JIO user for fibre connectivity and cable TV. Still it is asking. This started after IOS 14 update.
10/2/20, 12:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sir woh joke tha
10/2/20, 12:22 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The point is a telco already knows whatever you are afraid to give
10/2/20, 12:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Only telcos and banks have this kind of super power
10/2/20, 12:23 - Fintech Aayush NnR: May be a couple of others
10/2/20, 12:23 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: True. For this matter, no app should force us to give permission for any access on mobile.
10/2/20, 12:24 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: I understand. But this means that IOS 14is really driving app companies to work harder.üòÇ
10/2/20, 12:30 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Cant do that on iOS
10/2/20, 12:31 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: iOS 14 has made it harder for apps and permissions seeking more transparent for consumers
10/2/20, 12:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Wait but aren‚Äôt there two ways of doing that for a telco?
10/2/20, 12:31 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: At the server level they know who is the sender. May not be reading the message but they know HDFC bank, Amazon etc are sending you messages. That‚Äôs good enough
10/2/20, 12:32 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Telcos have no dependence on device or OS to read SMSes
10/2/20, 12:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: One is the software level but the other is via their own mechanics? Why do they need OS to read the sms? I am not sure.
10/2/20, 12:32 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Exactly
10/2/20, 12:32 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: As per my understanding the way messages are ‚Äúsent‚Äù today by telcos they are NOT read
10/2/20, 12:33 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: And are encrypted on the server
10/2/20, 12:33 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: NOT vs. CANT
10/2/20, 12:33 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hahaha
10/2/20, 12:33 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: As per my understanding also telcos don't read sms 'fully'
10/2/20, 12:33 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Agreed. If they have a mal-intent they still can
10/2/20, 12:34 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Exactly
10/2/20, 12:34 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: So technically unless telcos want to be unethical they shudnt have access to the sms content
10/2/20, 12:35 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Like i said unless there is mal intent there is no human or machine reading the content
10/2/20, 12:36 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Ethics and Jio. What‚Äôs that üßê
10/2/20, 12:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I dont think so. SMSs can be spoofed easily. So, it‚Äôs unlikely there is any level of security in the backend.
10/2/20, 12:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÖ
10/2/20, 12:37 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: üòÇ
10/2/20, 12:37 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: üòÑ
10/2/20, 12:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Is it still mal-intent if there is no law against it?
10/2/20, 12:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Hope you guys got the point
10/2/20, 12:37 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Unless something is illegal, it‚Äôs legal
10/2/20, 12:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Legal doesnt mean good intent! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/2/20, 12:38 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: I have seen many celebrity not using mobile or use the old 2G phone only.
10/2/20, 12:38 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Spoofing = hacking
10/2/20, 12:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Smarter than Bezos
10/2/20, 12:39 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: If you hack the server you have access to customer information too.
10/2/20, 12:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not at all.
10/2/20, 12:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I dont need access to your telco to spoof your SMS.
10/2/20, 12:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Or to send your number a spoofed SMA
10/2/20, 12:41 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Its still gaining access without my permission. So how do u define it?

10/2/20, 15:38 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on FIAKS eBulletin 2.0 on *Foreign banks only 3% of deposit is insured as against 44.5% insurance to deposits in cooperative banks. And private sector only 17.4% deposits are insured*_ WHY ? 

*View 1* CEO 

The size of deposits with co-op banks, RRBs and small finance is generally small. As such more of their deposits will be fully  covered. 

*View 2* CXO MNC Bank

But cooperative banks never get to see the value of the Insurance... PMC is a prime example...

*FIAKS Question* : Isn't cooperative banks unnecessarily wasting lots of money on paying *insurance premium* adding no value to depositors(you saw what happened to depositors of PMC Bank)  while foreign banks are saving on this front exposing large amount deposit that remains without insurance?

Ideally Cooperative bank deposit should be more safe compared to Private or Foreign bank?. Regulators have given unconditional guarantee to private bank (eg YES Bank), please do all non- sense.. we are there to bail you out from tax payers money. Sad ! Sad !!

*View 9* CXO cooperative bank 

Look at branch opening in rural by RBL bank, DCB bank, IndusInd Bank, Federal bank, Yes bank, South Indian bank üòÇ

*View 5* CXO banker 

Foreign banks  cater to very high networth clients who may be keeping 50 lakhs average balance with them  of which only 5 lakhs is covered by insurance.  But smaller banks esp *co-op banks* will have large number of depositors keeping less than 5 lakhs and hence fully insured deposits.  Since the cap is at an account level only way to bring down the cost of insurance is by pushing up the ticket size of deposits.  We should consider that small banks are able to compete better thanks to the safety insurance cover offers.

*View 7*
Cost serving *non smartphone* users big. Insurance needs to be subsidised for cooperative banks and regulatory authorities should load that cost on Pvt and mnc banks. 
Instead of putting restrictions on cooperative bank.. Need to open newer opportunities and better support is expected for them. Isn‚Äôt it ?

_An undergraduate shared these insights from his latest read on *What India needs to do to be a successful economy*_

If we need to be a fair economic society, we need to leverage our *female labour force*. In terms of women participation, just 23% of working age Indian women participated in our labour force, second last to Saudi Arabia among G20 countries. It is also below Nepal, where roughly 80% of women work. Nearly 120m Indian women have atleast secondary education,but they do not participate in the workforce. *A major reason for them to not do so was unpaid care work*. This is the work of caring for children and elders, of managing a household. Indian women are responsible for 87% of unpaid care work, compared to 72% in China and 61% in the US respectively. In India,women perform 9.8 times as much care as men.If all of this unpaid work were valued and compensated in the same way as paid work, it would contribute to *$300bn* to India's economic output. Of the 12 crore educated Indian women, even if half of them entered the workforce,the share of total workers(men and women) with atleast a secondary education in the workforce would jump from 33% to 46%. *Their engagement would add $440B to India's GDP* .The childcare system of several countries providing affordable day care and paid leave offers some solutions for India. In Sweden,if parents share time off, they receive tax credits.Financial incentives, creative approaches to flexible work solutions, along with tax and pension credits more than doubled the amount of paternity leaves Swedish men took.Private care providers receive public funding only if they follow national quality guidelines.No household has to pay more than 3% of it's income as childcare fees, raising low-income families access to care. Single mothers do 16.5% more paid work as a result. Austria lowered the income tax on second earners to encourage women's participation in the workforce.In 2017, the U.K went a step further to correct gender bias by requiring a disclosure of pay gaps from large employers(250 or more employees). In the second year of it's implementation,44% of it's employers noted an improvement in the pay gap from the previous year. Most Nordic countries and Asian countries like Japan and South Korea strongly encourage working fathers to take time off, making it mandatory quite often.If India focussed on childcare alone,it could add up to four million new jobs in the care industry and help up to 10m additional women participate in the workforce. *Another example is Indonesia:a country where 50% of it's MSMEs are owned by women*. In India,this figure is lower than 14%. Digital platforms expand possibilities,allowing quick and low-cost access to global markets for smal-scale ventures.In Indonesia,the share of women owned MSMEs in e-commerce revenue is 35% compared with only 15% in offline buisnesses.

10/5/20, 10:09 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: They don‚Äôt delete side loaded apps hence don‚Äôt think they will. Strategically also does not make sense.
10/5/20, 10:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Strategically, how does google really benefit from paytm? 0 revenue & 101 cockiness against their rules! üòè
10/5/20, 10:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This is a war cry by Paytm.

Is there anything stopping them from enforcing such an act? Technically, its not a big deal. 

Paytm just gave google a perfectly good reason / excuse to do that!

Paytm acted as judge / jury & executioner when they decided to cut off all aggregators, after having had agreements with them. 

So, why should google allow them to act as an ‚Äúapp aggregator‚Äù when their rules prohibit it?‚Äô
10/5/20, 10:25 - Vodaphone shailesh Nn: Google will play smart. And remember they have a tie up with Ambani. Paytm and Ambani also don‚Äôt mix so we are going to look at lots of fun and games in the coming days. Some seen and lots of unseen battles will happen to decide. The Chinese are supporting Paytm. That‚Äôs an interesting context from a current scenario. Govt can just say all ads need to have a footer which says ownership of the company ü§ê
10/5/20, 10:29 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: Also, google being operating system, even to host PayTM you need android OS or IOS which may take little while to develop own and popularise.
It will be too early to say the outcome but seems like a ego fight and in meanwhile Bharat store may get launched which will be more effective.

10/5/20, 10:34 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Guys this is not an App Storee, it‚Äôs just cleverly named to get PR. The media doesn‚Äôt understand what it prints most of the time. This is a web app loading inside another app. This has been done by multiple other players - including Google Spot within Google Pay, PhonePe Switch within PhonePe.
10/5/20, 10:35 - Fintech Monica Jasuja Mastercard IiNC: It‚Äôs so old, it‚Äôs already wine
10/5/20, 10:36 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: This a pure publicity stunt. Swadeshi feeling. üòÖ
10/5/20, 10:37 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Lacking flavour though üòÇ
10/5/20, 10:40 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: The most important reason why an app developer needs an app store is the volume of installs that it drive. If Paytm can actually drive substantial downloads for the app developer, it would be very relevant. And it doesn't matter whether someone else has done it earlier. There were a lot of wallets which existed before Paytm came in!
10/5/20, 10:41 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: There's No download here sir. These are webapp, which ia running inside Paytm app üòä
10/5/20, 10:41 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: Ok, let me put it other way. If it drives usage, it is helpful
10/5/20, 10:41 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Even I can't do a add to homescreen.
10/5/20, 10:41 - Fintech Aayush NnR: True, and there are even more now, and better ones.
10/5/20, 10:42 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Technically nothing stops them from becoming an alternative to PlayStore on Android. And they may well become. 
But thats besides the point. 

The point really is that are they ready to be a store in terms of
- guidelines
- fair play 
- marketing
10/5/20, 10:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The larger point is competition cures chutzpah.
10/5/20, 10:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let there be fights
10/5/20, 10:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Companies need to fight it out and that is the only way market can play its hand, let‚Äôs let it happen
10/5/20, 10:43 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Any stats on these "Superapps". I know quite of them closed theke shop.
10/5/20, 10:43 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: For a young app like ours (Park+), it is important to get as much usage from as many channels as possible. And we would like to be present on all platforms who can drive usage/traffic for us

And this is at a very low variable cost.
10/5/20, 10:44 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: That would be true for lot of startups as well. Doesn't mean that we start discouraging startups as well
10/5/20, 10:44 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Curious: Would you invest maintaining a custom view if it brings you less than 100 customers a month
10/5/20, 10:44 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Yes. But we should always analyse why they failed.
10/5/20, 10:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Let‚Äôs see what platform happens and what rules apply uniformly when it happens
10/5/20, 10:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I will be surprised if these new platforms also don‚Äôt have rules that favour friends and family
10/5/20, 10:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: I mean being the judge, jury, executioner is the vertical intregration of Indian companies
10/5/20, 10:46 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: That depends upon my current scale and effort involved in integration.

Right now Paytm mini is driving a few 1000 customers for us on monthly basis. This number has some relevance for us today, would not be relevant in 2 months as we scale
10/5/20, 10:47 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If SDK is the same, why not?
10/5/20, 10:47 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Mostly the view remains same for all.
10/5/20, 10:48 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If the marginal cost of maintenance is 0, any additional unit achieved is better than not achieving the additional unit.

And I am sure that the SDK would be the same.

No one in their right mind would want to build a different version for a different App Store.
10/5/20, 10:49 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Do payment provide some discounts/cashbacks?
10/5/20, 10:50 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Technically its not an sdk but a web view. 
My experience is that if you try to go with several players, the players themselves want to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the experience by ‚Äúcustomising‚Äù the views. 

And you often end up with 4-5 different instances if web views that need to be separately deployed and maintained. But i agree with Amit that when you startup, it makes sense. May not be core after a few months
10/5/20, 10:50 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: Park+ today pays Paytm 2% for every txn

Also Paytm provides Park+ with some marketing visibility
10/5/20, 10:54 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Does paytm provides any cashback to your customers?
10/5/20, 10:55 - PAYTM Amit Lakhotia Nn: Cashback offers are on and off offers
10/5/20, 10:55 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Okk
10/5/20, 10:59 - Fintech Ravi Pynda Ravikanth NnR: Haptik was the first
10/5/20, 11:00 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes, that‚Äôs the good part about Haptik, they were the first at a lot of things.
10/5/20, 11:03 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: The first one was actually an App called HelpChat. That was later renamed to Tapzo. Later amazon acquired it and shut it down

Haptik realised soon enough that this is neither creating scale or substantial moneys for them. And failed early which is good
10/5/20, 11:04 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah Tapzo and Haptik outcompeted each other in launching new products and changing their product names, one only faster than the other.
10/5/20, 11:05 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And I don‚Äôt think any of them failed early
10/5/20, 11:07 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: If players has kept it running for 3 -5 years without substantial revenues, i would call haptik building trying failing within 2 years definitely early :)
10/5/20, 11:08 - Fintech Aayush NnR: But Haptik is 2013 startup
10/5/20, 11:08 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: When they started the Ai bot
10/5/20, 11:09 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Aakrit rather focused on AI based b2b2c chatbot which has helped them grow
10/5/20, 11:09 - Fintech Ravi Pynda Ravikanth NnR: Yes tapzo

10/5/20, 11:09 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Which again was a flop
10/5/20, 11:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yes
10/5/20, 11:10 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Akosha became HelpChat became Tapzo

10/5/20, 11:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah and not stopping to stem at all
10/5/20, 11:18 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Akosha was a very diff product. Primarily complaint redressal. They changed to helpchat with a chat platform. And then tried super app with tapzo. Nothing worked. Worst still amazon bought and closed then
10/5/20, 11:18 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Amazon buying was a fire sale acquihire
10/5/20, 11:20 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: From what i know, At that time amazon was also desperate to get something to ‚Äúfire‚Äù payments. They also tried to acquire several other payments startups before amazon pay

Guys this is not an App Store, it‚Äôs just cleverly named to get PR. The media doesn‚Äôt understand what it prints most of the time. This is a web app loading inside another app. This has been done by multiple other players - including *Google Spot within Google Pay, PhonePe Switch within PhonePe*.

The PayTM app store - its not an app store. It lacks the many basic fundamental requirements in an app store.
BUT coming to the basics of the need for a "nation owned" app store, *we need to revive this with MeITY / govt or others. we need neutral national app stores* - maybe the OS providers here - Indus etc can be extended for this capability. Building an app store is not an overnight task as done. Building an app store is "engineering" as you have mentioned above. Getting Indus to detail out a full scope of an app store and we will have more to discuss.

*View 65*  _FIAKS Maven 2019 and 2020_

India‚Äôs own App Store... well a great idea whose time has come I guess. Though as others opine, this one is more a container app than an app store.

First, I don‚Äôt know if PayTM is planning to build a mobile OS. If it does, keeping the economics aside, that becomes the primary foundation for an app store ... I assume that isn‚Äôt the cause, for this note.

BTW: if it isn‚Äôt the case, an app will still need to be hosted on Google/ Apple stores! üôÑ

Next, for a true app store, there must be a developer environment that needs to be made available. It cannot be restricted to a payment related idea which may be built on this, but any foreseeable idea.

Then there must be an app submission/ verification workflow, a beta environment, and an appsec setup. The developer has to still operate within the boundaries of the platform.

The app then needs to be published‚Äîit should be a pull model, rather than >>all<< apps being visible in a menu/ grid layout.

And last but not the least, there must be a developer community, willing and excited to create new apps on the said platform.

There will be more pre-requisites, but this is what I could think of, for now.

Hack has an easy fix which I am surprised Google could not have thought of. The relative positioning of the devices would be unchanged which should give a clue that this is a simulation rather than the reality which is expected to be far more random. For a company built on recognition of patterns, missing this is a bit of a puzzle, isn't it?

To support this above question an entrepreneur says ‚Äúthe strongest banks in the world get most of their business from their home country. They have a global presence in a measured manner and limited global revenue.‚Äù The Fintech story seems to be following the same path. Visa and MasterCard solved that well through great partnerships with banks across the world. That‚Äôs a model that seemed to have worked. Today, given the Nationalism challenges, even that model is threatened.

Will there be any scope for global financial players? What is the successful Model going forward?

Community member says recently I took reliance *Jio Internet connection*. The interaction with sale team was amazing and was  *Paperless* . The sales representative entered all the details in mobile app. However I was surprised to note that the sales guy took a print screen of the data that he entered on the mobile app. Aadhar Number comes on screen on scanning the QR code and it‚Äôs not encrypted. On asking sales person says that it is required for query resolution from call centre. On resisting he went to photo gallery and deleted and but kept all pics in  trash folder. 

On further investigation I was surprised to see 100‚Äôs of customer Aadhar details are saved as *PRINT SCREEN* by the sales staff in thrash folder. This can easily be sold in the open market. 

Q1 *Aren‚Äôt the guideline mandating an app company to encrypt the customer Aadhar details*

*Q2*  *Also shouldn‚Äôt the print screen functionality to be disabled on these mobile handsets?*  why should personal handset be used here why can‚Äôt it be another mobile handset which is treated as *Registered Device* 

*Q3*- Shouldn‚Äôt UIDAI suspend license AUA/KUA involved in this transaction?

This week,
Among the vendors mentioned in the graphic below, guess:

*Q1. The only vendor who had a Positive Annual Growth from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020*

*Q2. The vendor with the highest market share as of Q2 2020*



üõë *IMPORTANT* 
_Members kindly note Final answers will be shared ONLY in the communities participating in QUIZ by *6pm IST*._

10/9/20, 15:56 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: 1. Apple
2. Huawei & Samsung were both at 20% each,  though Huawei claims to have crossed Samsung numbers marginally.
10/9/20, 15:56 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: üëç
10/9/20, 15:59 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 1 for Q1.*

This vendor launched a new smartphone which accounted for around 28% of its global volume!
10/9/20, 16:40 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 2 for Q2.*

Q2. This vendor had the second largest market share in Q2 2019.
10/9/20, 17:23 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 3*

The answers are definitely not HTC and Nokia!
10/9/20, 18:12 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 95*

Q1. The only vendor who had a Positive Annual Growth from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020
*Ans. Apple (25% Growth)*

Q2. The vendor with the Highest Market Share as of Q2 2020.
*Ans. Huawei, with a market share of 19.6%*

The source of the data is Canalys estimates (sell-in shipments), Smartphone Analysis, July 2020. *The global smartphone market plummeted 14% in Q2 2020, with Apple the only top vendor to grow.*

Apple defied expectations in Q2. Its new iPhone SE was critical in the quarter, accounting for around 28% of its global volume, while iPhone 11 remained a strong best-seller at nearly 40%. As well as the new iPhone SE, Apple is also demonstrating skills in new user acquisition. 

In addition, market share leadership rankings changed from Q2-2019 to Q2-2020 as Huawei toppled Samsung from the top position. It was also the clear market leader in China, taking 44% market share. Huawei shipped 55.8 million units, compared to Samsung‚Äôs 53.7 million in Q2 2020. Xiaomi came fourth, shipping 28.8 million units, which was down 10%, and Oppo reclaimed fifth place from Vivo, shipping 25.8 million units with a 16% decline.

As lockdowns ease, many countries allowed offline retail stores to reopen, but footfall remained low. Going forwards, vendors will need to switch channel focus at short notice, to adapt to second-wave outbreaks. In addition, geopolitical uncertainty also hangs over the global smartphone market.

10/10/20, 11:19 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Hope no one here is affected
10/10/20, 11:46 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Three clear trends from looking at our own business and talking to friends and colleagues across startups.

1. Looks like a V shape recovery at the moment.
2. Recovery might outpace previous all time high numbers for a lot of startups much sooner than expected
3. 2020/2021 will be very big for well poised startups, most of them will exceed expectations of growth / revenue / valuation / EBIT / FCF, some of this might seem very surprising to people who are not in startups

Mostly good news, hope this Covid-19 situation improves fast.

_FIAKS Bespoke_ *What If WhatsApp and Google Blacklist A Particular Country?*

The entire country will be dependent on WhatsApp & Google with no backup or alternative plans, isn‚Äôt it?

So, no bank needed(they are already offering few banking services), no NPCI needed(NUE), no RBI/regulator needed (Cryptocurrency), no telecom needed as they offer voice and messaging services too!! 

Are we understanding the risk here? Risk is at- _country level, company level, and individual level_

To spur innovation it makes sense to have a 2-tier license, one which is bank-sponsored and therefore ultimately the funds are held with and insured by a Tier1 bank. The second could be an independent license that carries more responsibility and therefore also allows more flexibility to the new entrants.

Regulatory authorities will find it difficult to issue a digital banking license. As the fresh license category may give advantage to digital banks over payments banks. There will be no takers for any license category with more restrictions compared to payments banks.

‚ñ™Ô∏èWant to go to friends place, Uber Ola is *asking OTP* 
‚ñ™Ô∏èWant to call for food, delivery guy is *asking OTP*
‚ñ™Ô∏èGST filing CA is *asking OTP* 
‚ñ™Ô∏èIncome tax return, *one more OTP*
‚ñ™Ô∏èNews subscription on Bloomberg. One more OTP. 
‚ñ™Ô∏èUPI one more OTP 

100‚Äôs of OTP in a day we are required to share and honestly not able to track which OTP am giving to whom. Can we have 

*Q1*- _Should Regulatory guidelines standardise these OTP Text message saying company XYZ is asking OTP for your purchase decision product ABC with date and time stamp and an expiry_  as against sms like these ‚Äúyour OTP is 234‚Äù.  Also who are authorised to generate OTP?

*Q2* _can we some way segregate OTP for financial transactions versus non-Financial Transaction?_  This will help to reduce  online frauds. 

*Q3* is OTP Safe ? I am told any one can read these OTP on SMSC server.. isn‚Äôt it ? Are they safe 

*Q4* OTP are getting read by the apps unknowingly. Can we ban such services / functionality

_Invite your views and guidance on this subject_

*View 19* _start up founder_

Are Regulatory Authorities Banks, NPCI aware that SMS OTP is unsafe ? Are we putting customers to such a BIG risk by having Aadhar Auth services for opening bank accounts, fund transfer, Income tax returns filing basis these OTP‚Äôs ..what‚Äôs happening in this country ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*View 14*.  _Doctorate in Law_

*View 17* _Chief Digital Officer of an organisation which employee more than 5lakhs people_ 

The world has moved beyond OTPs long ago. NIST has been advising against SMS OTP for a long time (at least since 2017). Please note that colloquially "OTP" is understood as SMS OTP. Multiple other versions of OTP/challenge exist, e.g. Google (shows a challenge on device you are already logged in), Apple, Microsoft Authenticator and so on. 

*View 6* _Founder with Telco back ground_

*The transmission of an SMS in GSM network is not secure*

The SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its *store-and-forward feature*, and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet. When a user is roaming, the SMS content passes through different networks and perhaps the Internet that *exposes it to various vulnerabilities and attacks*. Another concern is arisen when an adversary gets access to the phone and reads the previous unprotected messages. To exploit the popularity of SMS as a serious business bearer protocol, it is necessary to enhance its functionalities to offer the secured transaction capability. Data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are the most important security services in the security criteria that should be taken into account in many secure applications. *However, such requirements are not provided by the traditional SMS messaging*.

10/13/20, 00:05 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Strangely enough some Canadian carriers / telco plans do not forward SMS when roaming outside the country. In such cases, OTP by sms becomes a bottleneck. We also have to keep in mind that SMS is the lowest common denominator and its readily accessible to all. On the contrary, using Google Authenticator or another software based OTP is not easy for non-tech people.

So, while the security of SMS can be suspect, there is a trade-off to using it when you consider reach of the SMS technology vs other technologies.

1.  It is expecting customers to be tech savvy to download apps to go websites to manage the card account 
2. big issuers like HDFC dont even have a credit card functionality on the app. Only on their really badly designed/non mobile friendly websites
3. Is this done to reduce fraud? - ints this angle covered by 2FA compliance 
4. Lastly, isnt driving awareness hard amongst this? (Just to cite that ever since Covid, bank tele helplines have become really really bad. Some have even resorted to "send an email", unless there is a card block request)

Reserve Bank of India: Enhancing Security of Card Transactions 
Effective October 1, 2020

New Cards
All new DR/CR cards issued by the banks will be only enabled for domestic transactions at ATMs and PoS terminals  
New cards issued by any bank from this month will need to comply with the regulation, so by default the cards will be in ‚ÄòOff‚Äô mode, and customers will need to activate the feature (for eComm purchases). This can be activated instantly/real-time via the bank app/website.

Existing Cardholders
Issuers may take a decision based on their risk perception, whether to disable the CNP(domestic & int‚Äôl) transactions, card present (int‚Äôl) transaction and contactless transaction rights. 
Treasury Feedback from HDFC & Citi - All existing cardholders will continue to have access to performing e-Comm transactions. By default, the banks have enabled eComm purchases as ‚ÄòOn‚Äô and the customer has a choice to turn it ‚ÄòOff‚Äô
All the DR/CR card users from now on are allowed to set up transaction limits.

Existing Inactive Cardholders
RBI has asked all the banks and card issuing companies to disable online payments for all those DR/CR cards which have never been used for online or contactless transactions in India or abroad. These consumers will have to proactively enable their cards to ‚Äúon‚Äù mode for eCommerce.

10/14/20, 16:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: between me and wife, we have so many of those base chargers lying around, still in the pack.. in the last 10 years, i have either used bose headphones and airpods.. so, we also have atleast 15 pairs of new headphones lyinng around unused..
10/14/20, 16:04 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Don't be a fanboy. If it's done for "Environmental Reasons", at least charge less (The charger/headphone amount). I know many Apple users who uses oem charger/headphone only.
10/14/20, 16:04 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: everyone can't pay for fancy headphones
10/14/20, 16:06 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: you speaking in indian context where average monthly salary is less than iphone price, and people save up months to buy an iphonne.
this doesnt apply to majority of the world.. even if you are a janitor at mc.donalds, a top end iphonne is not even your 1 months salary..
10/14/20, 16:07 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: do you have any stats how many iPhone owner buy an airpod or bose headphones in EU or US? If yes please share.
10/14/20, 16:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: premium brands are not in the affordability business.
you got to be naive to think so. no other phone brand comes even close to the actual hardware quality of apple. even premium phones of samsung and other brands have cheap plasticy feel. so, where is the comparison?
10/14/20, 16:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: also, even if u dont use a airpods, u inevitably have old airpods and chargers
10/14/20, 16:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: 35 million airpods sold last year..
10/14/20, 16:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: since, 2019.. 60 million airpods.. and people wont change airpods everytime they change phones..
10/14/20, 16:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i think, 60 million was just in 2019..
10/14/20, 16:11 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: worldwide?
10/14/20, 16:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and why u sure price not reduced? maybe they would have added 1500 more to the price, if it was included? did they discuss with you before pricing the box with the charger and headphones? ü§™
10/14/20, 16:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: possibly. so, am guessnig there are 100million+ airpods alone in the market.
10/14/20, 16:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and its not something u change with each phone or throw away, like the in-box headaphones..
10/14/20, 16:14 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: If I have an iPhone 10 which, and now want to upgrade to iPhone 12, I have to give away my Headphones/charger right? Suppose I dont give away the chargers/headphone, then 2 things happen. First, I am paid less exchange value, secondly I am left with a 5watt charger, which will take years to charge new iPhone 12. And I am not able to use a New feature "Fast Charging" in the new iPhone, although I paid for the Feature.
10/14/20, 16:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: no. they dont refurbish headphones for hygiene reasons. charger, am not sure.
10/14/20, 16:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: also, thats why it makes to not give default chargers, coz most people buy a fast charger anyway.
10/14/20, 16:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i have NEVER used a default charger ever..
10/14/20, 16:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: makes sense to*
10/14/20, 16:16 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: in 2018, apple sold 35million Airpods, where iPhone Sales were 217million. Considering, people who carry older iPhones also bought the Airpod, the ratio is significantly less.
10/14/20, 16:17 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Here is what Apple believes and most of us should too: If we are worried about the charger price being more, we certainly can‚Äôt afford the iPhone, so we shouldn‚Äôt bother, so shouldn‚Äôt Apple.

Apple has been very clear about all this since Jobs died, at the least.

In a way, they are not wrong. The user segmentation takes cares of itself because of price.
10/14/20, 16:17 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: please dont mix "you" with "most"
10/14/20, 16:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: in a market like india, people are ready to pay 3 months salary to buy an apple phone because of its aspirational value too..

its not like theres much you can do on an apply phone, than you cant do on a xiaomi phone, at 1/10th the cost. affordability is never the priority.

the more expensive it is, the more people will want it..
10/14/20, 16:23 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats the launch year. airpod nnumbers accummulate every year... its probably 100 or 120m+ by now..
10/14/20, 16:26 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: it's not about the money sir. It's about the necessity. Forget Headphones, a Charger is a NECESSITY. 
Every year all companies increase their charging speed. 5W to 12W to 18W to 30W to 65W.
If someone is using a old generation charger, he cant use the latest charging speed. This makes him BOUND to buy a charger where he already paid $1000 to $1500 for a phone, which has a BOM cost of ~$300

10/14/20, 16:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: you calling a 1.5 lakh iphone a NECESSITY, in a country with per capita income of under 50k/year?
10/14/20, 16:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yeah.. but you are in the clouds! üòÇ
10/14/20, 16:27 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: please read the message again üòÜ
10/14/20, 16:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: tale eg, in uk, an average person buys the phone on contract.. at about 40-80/month.. which includes unlimited data and calls..
but thats only 1 days MINIMUM WAGE.. for perspective, his rental is probably 10 times that..

what about here? i guess contract concept has picked up here, but even an entry level software engineer would probably be paying close to his room rent, in monthly payments to buy a iphone + data package..
10/14/20, 16:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i know what you mean.. but, necessity is defined by segment..
10/14/20, 16:28 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: a CHARGER with a PHONE is NECESSITY. iPHONE is NOT
10/14/20, 16:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: compare accesories given free by hyundai, and porsche..
10/14/20, 16:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: its the same..
10/14/20, 16:30 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: accessories. But I guess if Porsche asks you to buy a fuel tank separately, you will be in my place
10/14/20, 16:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: or a ferrari.. do you know ferrari batteries dont last more than 7 days, if unused?

do you think they give free charger? no, my dear. you have to pay nearly a lakh, for a stupid 12v trickle charger! 

so, what u think? starting ur car after 7 days is a nnecessity or luxury? üòÇ
10/14/20, 16:30 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Accessories != Necessity
10/14/20, 16:31 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I guess you need to read some concepts of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering üòÑ
10/14/20, 16:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: welcome to the premium world. just so you know, average cost of accessories/add-ons when ordering as porsche is 25% of car value.
10/14/20, 16:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: same applies to any "premium" car brand.. in the global sense..
10/14/20, 16:32 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and why is that? üßê
10/14/20, 16:32 - +91 90233 89243: Apple is still giving a lightning cable for charging I think, so necessity is covered imo.
10/14/20, 16:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yes. sort off.
infact, a lot of electronics today come with only usb cable and not charger, because of how many chargers u find in a household
10/14/20, 16:34 - +91 90233 89243: if you want, you can buy an adapter, which I think is okay, person buying 1000$ can pay some extra , my thoughts.
10/14/20, 16:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats the point. apple is selling premium. not value-for-money..

its just lame to blame them for pricing. blame them for something else, if you want to find faults. lol
10/14/20, 16:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: this is true for every premium brand. if you cant afford it, you want it more. simple.
10/14/20, 16:36 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: If a car battery is fried, you can go to a mechanical shop and give it a jump start, then you need to just get the fuel and run. Try the same thing with a iPhone üòÑ
10/14/20, 16:37 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: üòÜüòÜüòÜ
10/14/20, 16:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: sure. goto ur friends house and charge ur iphone then! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10/14/20, 16:37 - +91 90233 89243: Many things to blame them for , but still I think they have an upper hand on their processing power and hardware.
10/14/20, 16:38 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: yes. user experience. hardware quality. general premium feel.
untouched by competition.
10/14/20, 16:38 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: If you buy a TV and company does not give you a remote and asks you to operate with the in panel switches, are you okay? You basic necessities are covered I gues??
10/14/20, 16:38 - +91 90233 89243: I wud differ on ux.
10/14/20, 16:39 - +91 90233 89243: Yup, if I had a spare remote.
10/14/20, 16:39 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: No sir, you bought a smart TV. üòÜ
10/14/20, 16:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: or if remotes were universal to many TVs
10/14/20, 16:39 - +91 90233 89243: Actualy now a days I operate it from my phone
10/14/20, 16:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and i use an universal remote!
10/14/20, 16:40 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: a lot of comparisons you make are not at equivalent products and nnot in global conntext.
10/14/20, 16:41 - +91 90233 89243: Yup
10/14/20, 16:41 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Yes. Same with Ferrari and Porsche
10/14/20, 16:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: in india, for an avg person, an iphone is probably the most expensive item in his house..
10/14/20, 16:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: more than his bike or tv or maybe even more than his annual rent.
10/14/20, 16:44 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: So I am assuming if Apple tomorrow says, we will fit the existing battery of your iPhone with your new iPhone, and this will significantly reduce the Carbon Footprint and you need to pay $50 extra for the same, you are okay with this right??
10/14/20, 16:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: in 2018, i had an entry level employee earning just 40k/month.. who bought an iphone and warranty, etc.. for 1.25 lakhs, while paying 10k rent.. it was an eye opener for me!
10/14/20, 16:46 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i actually did a bit of casual chit chat about this, and realised this is a rather common situation in india today, especially so among the entry level tech community.
10/14/20, 16:46 - +91 90233 89243: Why wud they do this?
10/14/20, 16:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: batteries deteriorate.. 

btw, in developed countries, u need to pay to get rid of old phones and laptops. you get penalized heavily if u throw them in the trash.. lol
10/14/20, 16:48 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Any electronics deteriorate. Chargers and Headphones also
10/14/20, 16:48 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: now, we arguing for sake of arguing... ü§®
10/14/20, 16:48 - +91 90233 89243: Batteries doesnt have an alternate for a phone. Chargers have.
10/14/20, 16:49 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Nope. Chargers and Headphone do deteriorate.
10/14/20, 16:49 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Who told you this? üôÑ
10/14/20, 16:50 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: not the point. how many people have spare or aftermarket phone batteries lying around their houses? thats the difference.
10/14/20, 16:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: do electronics that run on AAA batteries, always come with batteries in the pack?
10/14/20, 16:51 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if you have batteries easily available, or if u may have them lying around, it isnt a "necessity" anymore..
10/14/20, 16:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: anyway, lets not spam the group. its been a long discussion. lets agree to disagree!
10/14/20, 16:52 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Same argument lies with Chargers also. If I have a 5watt charger, and I bought a smartphone with 25W charging speed, what is I am supposed to do?
10/14/20, 16:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: hope you not going to buy this iphone, after all this dissinng! ü§™
10/14/20, 16:54 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: thats EXACTLY why they not giving the 5w charger free. and they cant include 25w charger without increasing price further. so buy separately! lol
10/14/20, 16:54 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: I am a small man with small requirements üòÑüòÑ
10/14/20, 16:54 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: The BOM cost between a W and 25W charger is merely $2-3
10/14/20, 16:54 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: *5W and 25W
10/14/20, 16:56 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: right. sensible comparison. value of iron by weight, of tata truck is 5x of ferrari.
10/14/20, 16:57 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: or whatever metal they use. just saying. lol
10/14/20, 16:58 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: üôèüôèüôè
10/14/20, 16:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: you are totally overlooking the value of branding / premium /etc. still talking of cost and BOM, or etc. ALL IRRELEVANT.

in this context, its worth what people are ready to pay for it.
10/14/20, 16:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: period.
10/14/20, 17:01 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Let's open a Digital Lending company to lend people to buy iPhone Charger üòÜ
10/14/20, 17:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: probably a hit idea. üòÇ

btw, whats cost diff between 5w and 25w charge in apple store?
thats the premium they would charge if they included it. not BOM or cost.

10/14/20, 17:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Thats the point. Giving something cheaper or making it value-for-money is not the best business to be in, always!
10/14/20, 17:26 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Anyhow, better get back to work, so that I can afford iPhones! üòÇ

Have a good day!

10/14/20, 17:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: or is that 200 billion now?

10/15/20, 10:06 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Question to all group members.

Many NBFCs do not properly update the CIBIL report. They do update in case of late payment but after closing the accounts they don't update the same. I had few accounts which I closed atleast 4-5 months back but still it's showing in my CIBIL report. They are not yet closed or updated. There are 3 duplicate accounts too, which is never  updated and although the amount is paid off, it's still showing same current balance. I guess this do effect my CIBIL score.
I needed a car loan that's why being a "Educated" person I myself checked my CIBIL report and found this anomalies. I have reported this issues to the "Fintech Company" and 15 days passed still they are fixing.
Now a normal person who doesn't have any idea about how to check the score or how to  raise a dispute, what should he do???

A member says, ‚ÄúI find it highly unethical, while Bank has continued to thrive, including their share price; it is ridiculous that a bank like them are expecting a reduction in rent. Would the bank have increased the rent, if the bank makes a profit more than expected? It is a strong-arm tactic from the bank. I have in particular never been a fan of such bank practices, while they come across as ethical banks, they follow a very strong arm and risk-averse practice.‚Äù

The Top 3 Countries with the highest density of Robot Workers in the Manufacturing Industry, as of 2019, are:

*No.1*
Singapore üá∏üá¨(918)

*No.2*
South Korea üá∞üá∑(855)

*No.3*
Japan üáØüáµ(364)

*The Rankings from 4-10 are as follows:*
4. Germany üá©üá™(346)
5. Sweden üá∏üá™(277)
6. Denmark üá©üá∞(243)

8. Chinese Taipei/ Taiwan üáπüáº(234)
9. United Statesüá∫üá∏ (228)
10. ItalyüáÆüáπ (212)

Data from the International Federation of Robotics reveals that the pace of industrial automation is accelerating across much of the developed world with 74 installed industrial robots per 10,000 employees globally in 2016. By 2020, that increased to 113 across the manufacturing sector. 

Manufacturing - which contributes about 20 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) and 14 per cent of total employment - is being impacted by new technologies, changes in global supply chains and consumer demands and  manufacturers are using robotics, to remain relevant.

In 2019, South Korea had 855 installed industrial robots per 10,000 employees. That is mainly due to the contiued installation of high volume robots in the electronics and electric sectors. Germany and Japan are renowned for their automotive industries and they have density levels of just around 350 per 10,000 workers. Interestingly, Japan is one of the main players in industrial robotics, accounting for over half of the global supply.

10/18/20, 17:47 - Vikas Business Phone: *FIAKS Gen Z Talent Show 6.0*

_An *undergraduate* shared these insights from his latest read on *What correlation between education & economic growth*_

One of the ways India can right the *talent mismatch* is by focusing on its secondary educated work force.These workers can become the technician, sales executive, customer service agent that will be needed as middle class expands. But that might not meet the aspirations of a college educated person.
According to the World Bank,the ‚ÄòAsian miracle‚Äô  that led South korea,Japan and Taiwan,among others,had more to do with investments in primary and secondary education than with investments in higher education.However,if these workers need to find jobs in their respective sectors,we need to strengthen our SMEs(Small and Medium Enterprises),as explained in a survey conducted by Tata Sons.This is something that is an efficient alternative to the definition of 'M'SMEs used by the government of India.FIAKS community member says according to TataSons,the Indian business landscape is characterized by a large number of micro-businessess,who optimistically call themselves ‚Äòentrepreneurs‚Äô. *These micro businesses,are just survival ventures,employing less than 10 people.If they had a chance,many of these ‚Äòentrepreneurs‚Äô would opt for staid,unglamorous jobs*.A survey conducted by Columbia University concluded that the average size of an *Indian firm in 2014 was just 2.24*,giving an indication of how many  educated workers would  remain unemployed. These firms employ over 70% of India's workforce working in *informal* private companies. The extent to which *formalised firms* are productive for an economy is also explained in another survey conducted by Columbia University which stated  that an Indian Manufacturing firm employing 50-200 employees is approximately four times as productive than the one that employees between five and fifty,because of their levels of formalization.These firms i.e five to fifty may relatively remain dormant to firms that are adept in technology, i.e 50-200 employees. A combination of three surveys conducted by Tata Sons,US Bureau of Labour Statistics (2014 data),OECD(2014 data) and the updated Economic Census of India concluded that the Micro firms(1 to 9 employees) employ 11% of the private sector employees in the US, 20% in Germany, 27% in Israel(70% for India), compared to *SMEs*(10 to 249 employees)that employed 36% of the private sector employees in the US,43% in Germany and 43% in Israel.

FAB Queries
‚ñ™Ô∏è *What is Primary education?* , the first stage traditionally found in formal education, beginning at about age 5 to 7 and ending at about age 11 to 13.

‚ñ™Ô∏è *What is Secondary education?*, the second stage traditionally found in formal education, beginning about age 11 to 13 and ending usually at age 15 to 18.

10/18/20, 21:36 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Federal Bank, with a ~1% market share, is an often ignored private bank in India.

But did you know it has the 4th highest debit card spend across private banks in the country? (yes, even more than Kotak!)

Here are the numbers for August 2020 across ATMs and POS machines: (in Rupees Lacs)

ICICI Bank: 23,85,075
HDFC Bank: 23,64,530
Axis Bank: 17,64,886
Federal Bank: 444,521
Kotak Mahindra Bank: 411,634

So how did a tiny bank gain such dominance? I checked out their Annual Report and a few things stood out:

‚Ä¢ It was the 5th bank in the country to introduce Debit Card EMI (in partnership with Pine Labs). This is mostly because they do not have/promote credit cards at all.
‚Ä¢ It has over 75+ campaigns and partnerships with leading brands like Flipkart, Amazon, BookMyShow etc. Partnerships provide better visibility and brand recall.
‚Ä¢ I figure their ‚ÄúCelesta‚Äù card for HNIs is driving a lot of spends, since this Scheme has generated over 1100 accounts (and ~‚Çπ500 Cr) for the bank in just one year!

Interestingly, their debit card strategy reveals a lot more about their overall bank strategy as well.

Community thought leader shared this message
‚Äú *ALERT:Amazon Prime has requested for Debit of Rs.1014.02 on2020-09-24:11:05:39 to validate CREDIT card xx1115. Not you?Call 18002586161*‚Äù

The card has been registered since 2 years. They possibly have a process to validate card every year or 6 months (unnecessary in any case). 

*Q1* Isn‚Äôt this process of validation every 6 months unnecessary? But look at the amount charged to validate card. This could have been Rs 100!! 
In india all banks do a -1/+1 penny drop transaction to validate card / account. They are doing Rs 1000+ and not even returning it. How is Amazon getting away with it ?

*Q2* Can an Indian bank/ PPI get away with such impunity? 

*Q3* Aren‚Äôt rule uniform for all ?   Or is that  Amazon getting away by i am not regulated like google & sponsor bank has no clue on it?ü§î

Though, I do not see why Amazon would do this.
10/19/20, 20:35 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: To auto debit credit card for prime membership
10/19/20, 21:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: he was probably charged for a 1 year.. its not a "card verification", then
10/19/20, 21:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: whole year is 999.. why would they verify with 1042? very odd. and I am very curious to know the full story behind this charge. lol

Bank is never given the reason of charge and will not be able to send customer a message like this. How will your issuing bank know Amazon prime requested for validation?
10/19/20, 21:09 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Amazon doesn't do auto debit for one year subscription

10/19/20, 21:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It could be a fraud too. Card thieves can have MIDs with generic Descriptors like "Amazon Prime".. acquirers like Stripe allow dynamic descriptors, and you can put whatever you want, easily..

10/21/20, 11:25 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *National Umbrella Entity(NUE): Do We Need Another NPCI?*

The regulator is allowing for-profit organizations to enter this space. _Why can‚Äôt NPCI be the umbrella entity itself and let various new organizations for profit or for non-profit be a part of existing NPCI?_ Allow NPCI to be for-profit and define regulations to allow profitable business models to come up for target segments for financial inclusion.

Well, having a second entity will also clarify NPCI‚Äôs own position as just one among equals, hopefully without any special treatment. It may hopefully make the Government think more carefully about announcing fee waivers without compensating the players involved, with the new players likely to argue their case more strongly. NPCI has done a great job and will continue to do so but there is always something more or better possible. NUE is an attempt by the regulator in that direction

One of the most impersonated brands was founded in 1998 in the U.S.A., by PhD students of Stanford University.
10/23/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 97*

The 3 Most Impersonated Brands in Phishing Scams are:

*No.1* 
Google 

*No.2*
Amazon 

*No.3*
WhatsApp

Phishing is among the most common cyber-attacks, targeting both individuals and companies. According to Verizon‚Äôs 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, roughly one third of successful data breaches involved phishing activity, and phishing was instrumental to 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents and the installation of backdoors to networks.
In recent years, phishing mails have become a lot more sophisticated and some of them are really hard to distinguish from legitimate mails. In many cases, such attacks involve the attacker imitating a well-known company/brand, a practice commonly known as ‚Äúbrand phishing‚Äù. According to a recent report from Check Point Research, technology companies appear most often in fraudulent emails, with Google, Amazon and WhatsApp topping the list of most impersonated brands.
 
Email phishing exploits were the second most common type after web-based exploits, compared to Q1 where email was third.  The reason for this change may be the easing of global Covid-19 related restrictions, which have seen businesses re-opening and employees returning to work.
10/23/20, 18:29 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: Looks like different researches have different "winners". I had recently read that Microsoft was one of the most impersonated brands in phishing this year. Turns out it is number 1 for Q3 2020, with DHL and Google taking the next 2 spots (as per this Checkpoint report).

*Why are wallets cannot be debited for any purchases using Google pay*

My per month earning is  Rs 35,000. I allocate funds as under:

Fixed Deposit - Rs 10,000 
Saving account - 14000 
Cash - 6000
Wallet(paytm/ phone Pe)- 5000

I had kept Rs 5000 in wallet  for watching movie, buying burger üçî, ordering pizza, paying vegetable and fish üê† etc  

These days whenever we buy burger or pizza, the POS generate QR code but I *cannot* pay using wallets like Phone Pe or Paytm.  The person says I accept only Google Pay and am forced to debit my bank account. 

Why can‚Äôt I Debit my wallet while using Gpay ? Why only bank account is allowed. It‚Äôs my money and how can a shopkeeper deny accepting payment thru wallets.

10/25/20, 09:18 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Wallet needs a separate PPI license I guess. UPI apps doesn't
10/25/20, 09:19 - Fintech Shirisha ghosh Torit NnR: Imo Wallets are thing of past. No "Valid" Use case now.
10/25/20, 09:27 - Vikas Business Phone: This message was deleted
10/25/20, 09:28 - Vikas Business Phone: I don't agree. Make it interoperable then people will use it.. 

Personally I find it useful only worry is every one is asking for GPay.

And the monies in wallets can not be debitted..

QR Regulation should enable use case for wallets
10/25/20, 09:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Wallets are convenient and useful. However, the business case for wallets is non-existent (at least in India). It worked great when no one was being charged anything - obviously that's not a sustainable model. People will stop using them the moment the smallest fee is applied.
10/25/20, 09:31 - Vikas Business Phone: Ok
10/25/20, 09:32 - Vikas Business Phone: <Media omitted>
10/25/20, 09:39 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: If the wallet is not 'useful' anymore, is it the regulator's prerogative to kill it? or should it die a natural death viz demand/ market?
10/25/20, 09:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: if you had to kill the useless, half of the govt, air india, bsnl, and sbi should be fired first! üòÇüòÇ
10/25/20, 10:10 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: few things

- Banning exclusive QR codes is a regulatory overkill. Consumers and merchants should have a choice and if companies want to invest in distribution and acquisition then why should it matter. 

- RBi has granted wallet licences to operate with capital requirements and thus shud let them operate as is. 

- If consumers dont want to use wallets, they will die their natural death, which is better than mandating rules to kill them. UPi based QRs anyways continue to exist and gain popularity.
10/25/20, 10:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: licenses come with plenty conditions - doesnt mean you have capital requirements and get a free pass on everything else.. conditions and restrictions are based on regulators focus on payments. and this move is obviously to do with promoting interoperability and thereby improving the payment ecosystem. 

are banks allowed to NOT accept inter-bank transfers, just because they meet their capital requirements? can bank NOT accept cheques from other banks?

in the short term, this sounds inconvenient to players who were hoping to dominate market with their might and hefty wallets, but in the long run, i personally feel this is a good move, for the end consumer.. which should be the focus..
10/25/20, 10:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and definitely good move for fintech ecosystem, by large.. coz now even small startups will have access to the entire QR code network..

very much like the mandatory open-banking prerogative in the EU..
10/25/20, 10:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: open-banking or open-QR (in this case) will have no meaning, if the bigger players chose not to participate.. and stay proprietary.. so, why not! i can definitely think of more positives than negatives, with this move..
10/25/20, 10:34 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: Ouch :)
10/25/20, 10:40 - EKO Anupam Varghese NnC: Does the end justify the means? Is it worth sacrificing freedom to innovate and differentiate, to being another brick in a large wall?
If the non-proprietary alternative is indeed better, it will anyway win, no?
10/25/20, 10:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: freedom? for fintech? thats an oxymoron! üòÇ
10/25/20, 10:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: what freedom does any fintech company have, anywhere in the world?
10/25/20, 10:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and non-proprietary alternative is better for the ecosystem and consumer, NOT for the dominant players. so, what reason would the big players have to open up their acquiring networks, unless forced by law?

If this were allowed then we‚Äôre talking 10 QR code‚Äôs for 10 wallets. That‚Äôs clearly costly for the merchant and for intermediate payment processors. 

At the very least this will reduce the cost of processing by enabling a common set of standards and reducing duplication of infrastructure. Ultimately that will being down the cost of processing as well, which is a good thing for provider and consumer alike.

Points that concerns me is 
‚ñ™Ô∏èwhether his team members and branch staff were  leaving office at 5pm the way he did ?

Well, the general perception is that fintech or private banks, or MNC banks are more agile or innovative compared to the government institutions. The fact is that the biggest innovation in the country is AADHAAR AND NPCI, both are government initiatives, isn‚Äôt it? 

*_‚ÄòInnovation for profitability‚Äô_* or *_‚ÄòInnovation to facilitate nation-building‚Äô_* are perhaps the options and depending upon priorities one would choose one over the other.

*View 15* CXO Banker shares his experience of UK üá¨üáß 

He says From 31 March 2020, the UK‚Äôs six largest banking groups will start checking whether the name entered on a bank transfer matches the names of the recipient bank account. It is hoped the move will combat transfer scams and errors and make it less likely customers‚Äô money ends up in the wrong hands.

This is introduced to help customers avoid transfer fraud in which the victim is provided with the bank details of a fraudster rather than the person to whom they believed they were transferring money. Common examples of this kind of transfer fraud include:

‚ñ™Ô∏èthe victim has a legitimate invoice to pay, but the fraudster intervenes (perhaps by intercepting emails or hacking an email account) to convince the victim to redirect the payment to an account they control.
‚ñ™Ô∏èinvoices being tampered with so that the account details for payment are switched to the fraudster‚Äôs account. This kind of fraud might be perpetrated from within a business by an employee with responsibility for raising/processing invoices.
‚ñ™Ô∏èa fraudster masquerades as a CEO or other senior company official and persuades an employee to transfer money to the fraudster‚Äôs bank account
a fraudster impersonating a trusted organisation, such as HMRC, the victim‚Äôs bank, or their utility company, and telling the victim a payment is owed.

ICICI is discontinuing the @pockets UPI ID handles and asking everyone who had them (it was one of the first UPI suffixes created) to get a new one. Almost feels it‚Äôs a flaw by design.

The ability to create UPI ids as needed is a good feature. But shutting down a @suffix is a bit like an email provider changing their domain name from @gmail to @alphabet‚Äù.

10/29/20, 13:49 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: Jack Ma has made headlines today for raising more than $34 billion in the World‚Äôs largest IPO in history for his company, Ant Group - which was only launched 6 years ago.

Trading starts next week on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, at a value of over $300 billion. What has made Ant Financial such a big deal, and why does this mark the end of big banks and the finance industry as we know it?

Traditional banks are set up as an expensive middle man, where banks charge us to store our money, give us less interest than our savings lose in inflation, and then loan the same money back to us at much higher interest, while also using that money to invest and keep all the profits.

Ant doesn‚Äôt work like a traditional bank. It‚Äôs an 'Amazon for money' that makes it easier - not more difficult - for us to earn, exchange and invest our money at a fraction of the cost, in a fraction of the time.

That‚Äôs how Ant has become the world‚Äôs highest-valued fintech company and the world‚Äôs largest digital payments platform with over one billion users and 80 million merchants today.

Beginning as Alipay in 2004 as a Chinese version of PayPal, Jack Ma connected his payment platform with over 200 Chinese Banks by 2010. While PayPal has stayed as a payment platform, Jack had other ideas, giving users multiple ways to make money with their money:

> Yu‚Äôebao, Ant‚Äôs investment platform allows users to invest their money directly in money markets, and is already the world‚Äôs largest money market fund.

> Zhima Credit, Ants‚Äô credit score system, gives users a way to get financing, lending, buy a house or car immediately based on their payment record, with over 10 million users getting credit even if other banks have given them a poor credit score.

> MYbank, Ants‚Äô online bank, can approve a loan in minutes. It has already given out over 20 million loans to companies that otherwise could not easily get them.

> Ant Fortune, Ant‚Äôs investment supermarket, gives financial institutions a place to reach all Ant users and to educate and serve them with their investment products.

> Xiang Hu Bao, Ant‚Äôs mutual protection plan, gives users a way to secure their own insurance by all paying in to a central fund that then pays out in the case of critical illness. Again, with no extra fees are charged to those who take part. Over 50 million signed up in the first six month.

> Antchain, Ant‚Äôs Blockchain-based platform, gives users a trusted network to transfer assets, including music, videos, articles, contracts and other IP with digital copyright certifications.

In 2014, Jack turned Alipay into Ant Group with a vision of turning Ant into the Amazon of money. And that is what it has become. 

While traditional banks give a poor customer experience and make it difficult to set up a new account, to make an international transfer or choose the right investments, Ant works like Amazon, where the customer experience is the main focus, at the fastest speed and the lowest price.

This is summed up in Ant‚Äôs ‚Äúthree-one-zero‚Äù process - three minutes to apply, one second to get a credit decision, and zero people involved in the decision.

In the same way that Amazon has led to any retailer who is not completely customer-focused going out of business, Ant is the new paradigm that will lead to every bank that is not completely customer-focused also going out of business in the coming decade.

As Bill Gates says, ‚ÄúThe world needs banking but it does not need banks.‚Äù

Banking is one industry that will be massively disrupted in the coming digital decade. Other industries ready for disruption include education, healthcare, energy, automotive, transportation, every industry still relying on middlemen, and government itself.

Which wave are you riding?
10/29/20, 14:21 - Fintech DBS Amit Jadhav Digibank Sgd NnC: It's really impressive that Jack Ma reached today, from where he started from but This model worked well in China coz Chinese regulations and firewall policy. It arises so many questions..... 
/ How much this model will be successful in open banking era. And in other continent's? Am highly doubtful. 
/ There's so many things to learn from this model but Is it replicable 'as-is'? Not particularly. 
/ If so much successful, why no competitors got created inside China, as there's big apple pie to share? There were but either alipay took them over or removed.
No doubt about technological advances done by Ant group and they will spread their wings across globe, changing traditional to to digital to intelligent to virtual to neo banking-finance.

If  I submitted all my mark sheets to college A to get an admission and later get to know that I have got an admission in better college say B... so again I have to  submit all the certificates to college B. Isn‚Äôt it painful? Why can‚Äôt central body be created in which all my mark sheets are kept with unique ID number like Aadhar Number. I just give that number and consent to shift from college A to College B

In case of Central KyC I need not submit same set of document again to shift bank accounts.  

In case if Account Aggregator 

*Q1* Why can't consent move from AA1 (eg Finvu) to AA2 ( Karvy). so that I need not have keep giving 100's of consent again to new AA2

*Q2* isn‚Äôt there a need to create a central body like NPCI or UIDAI to make it interoperable

a. the consent mechanism follow a federated architecture by design
b. data is encrypted and the consent artefact is digitally signed and the keys are maintained by a central registry (assigned by the regulator for the sector)
c. consent, as the name suggests is a user signed document that authorizes data transfer from data provider(s) to consumer(s) and hence must have enough granularity and uniqueness to prevent it being 'blanket' consent by default

10/30/20, 16:01 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 1*

It was established in the 17th century.
10/30/20, 16:45 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Some place in Italy? They did come up with the double-entry bookkeeping method around then, I think
10/30/20, 16:47 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 2*

The oldest bank was originally named to mean "Estates of the Realm Bank'.
10/30/20, 17:26 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 3*

It was founded in a European country.
10/30/20, 18:06 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 98*

The First and Oldest Central Bank in the World is:
*Sveriges Riksbank*

In 1668, Sweden's parliament decided to found Riksens St√§nders Bank (the Estates of the Realm Bank), which in 1867 received the name Sveriges Riksbank. The Riksbank is thus the world's oldest central bank.
The estates of the realm were the four classes of society. They represented the nobility, the clergy, the burghers  and the peasants in the Riksdag of the Estates until the reform  of 1866 when the system was replaced by a bicameral legislature.

Sweden is a small open economy that is highly affected by events in the global economy. By participating in international work, the Riksbank strives to the best of its ability to contribute to price stability and financial stability in the global economy. 

The Riksbank regularly participates in around 180 international committees and working groups. The Riksbank also has direct contacts with central banks in other countries to discuss issues of joint interest or to provide technical assistance (advice to central banks in emerging economies).

10/30/20, 21:07 - Vikas Business Phone: Will read sir
10/30/20, 23:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: The reason it won‚Äôt happen is because economics is as political as mathematical
10/30/20, 23:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: As someone once famously said, all economics is political economics
10/30/20, 23:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: in this proposal, seignorage shares go to the govt, unlike other privately managed currencies..
10/30/20, 23:16 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is why fiscal and monetary policies should be treated very separately but this is also why the entire world politics is trying to converge them both
10/30/20, 23:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: and obviously, this aint for large economies.. more for smaller econnomies with GDP under 100B
10/30/20, 23:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I meant.. seignorage revenue goes to the govt..
10/30/20, 23:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: like any normal fiat currency..
10/30/20, 23:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: outside of political issues, whats your take on the practicality of it, especially for a country like Zimbabwe which has never had a stable currency of its own?

10/31/20, 22:33 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: I have my own issues with HDFC bank. I hold an Infinia Credit card and an add-on card in my wife‚Äôs name. 

It seems HDFC system doesn‚Äôt allow to issue two different credit card numbers and both of our card numbers are the same. 

So, if my wife uses the card online, the OTP comes to my mobile number. It becomes extremely annoying when I am on a different time-zone.

10/31/20, 22:42 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: I don‚Äôt think so. 18 year old cannot be a kid and if so, there can be separate control features for those cards. 

From what I know, it requires an investment into their platform to enable separate card numbers and that‚Äôs getting deferred
10/31/20, 22:43 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Good one üòäüëç
10/31/20, 22:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Can you not give kids younger than 18 an add-on card?
10/31/20, 22:44 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: I am sure there is an age creiteria for add-on cards and it‚Äôs 18 years and above
10/31/20, 22:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Oh. Wasnt aware of that. So, kids below that age cant have a card of their own?

Not sure if it‚Äôs a guideline from RBI.
10/31/20, 22:52 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, this 18 is min age for primary card holder. I doubt there is a 18 requirement for supplementary card holder.
10/31/20, 22:53 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Sorry. Says 18 for add-on too! üòÖ

_An *undergraduate* shared these insights from his latest read on *Swami Vivekananda*_

The universe must be resolved into it's causes;the sun,moon,stars and earth,the body and mind,and everything in this universe must return to their finer causes, disappear,be destroyed as it were.But they will live in the causes as fine forms. Out of these fine forms they will emerge again as new earths,suns,moons and stars. Swami Vivekananda compares this philosophy to the real world. The seed comes out of the tree,but it does not immediately become a tree. It has a period of very fine unmanifested action. While working for some time beneath the soil,the seed breaks into pieces, degenerates as it were, and *regeneration comes out of that degeneration*.The same way,the whole universe has to work for a period unseen and unmanifested (called chaos),and out of that comes a new projection. This process is *known as a 'Kalpa' in Sanskrit*. We see that these finer forms develop slowly and gradually become grosser. These fine forms become grosser until they reach their limit,and later they go back further,becoming finer again. This process in modern times is known as evolution. However,every *evolution is preceeded by an involution*.The seed is the father of the tree,but another tree was itself the father of the seed.The seed is the fine form out of which the big tree comes,and another big tree was the form which is involved in that seed.Similarly,the whole of the universe was present in the fine cosmic universe.Everything exists through eternity, and will exist through eternity.The evolutionist will tell you that your idea of God is wrong.God is intelligent,but that intelligence develops much later on in the course of evolution. It is in man and the animals that we find intelligence, but millions of years have passed in this world before this intelligence came.In other words, the tree comes out of the seed,goes back to the seed;the *beginning and the end are the same*. 

It is unsurprising that such a man (Swami Vivekananda) could impress the likes of *Nikola Tesla and Leo Tolstoy*. However, it should be noted that this concept of the "big crunch" and the idea of a *multiverse* were expressed by Swami Vivekananda in 1895,a decade earlier than the much-celebrated set of papers of *Albert Einstein*,heralding a new age in Physics.

11/2/20, 18:54 - Vikas Business Phone: <234> FIAKS community Debates tonight on  *WHY PASSWORD IS REQUIRED TO BANK ACCOUNT STATEMENT* 

simple problem statement shared is  - banks should not make me enter a password for accessing my statement sent to my registered email with the bank. 

_Invite your views and guidance on this subject_

üî¥IMPORTANT
*Kindly note*:  _we will share one or two best responses only in *Participating communities* . Rest can be read in the *FIAKS bespoke* which will be released later incorporating all the views_

11/2/20, 18:59 - +91 90233 89243: Major issue with this is there is no standard way of generating this password and it becomes almost useless if you forget it.
11/2/20, 19:11 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: The password adds a bit of inconvenience, but I think it is useful to keep. It prevents casual access to statements, which is worth the extra step of entering a password. In some cases (like IVR based access to services) one of the questions used to be (not sure if it is still true) about the last transaction. This protection will help in such cases.
11/2/20, 20:31 - Fintech DBS Amit Jadhav Digibank Sgd NnC: There can be 2 type of bank account statements.
1. Download Open directly from ib / mb, via View eStmt section
2. Send email to cust account.

If at any point of time, you can able to access your ib/mb - view statement, then why bank is sending as pwd protected pdf. It's easy for cust to login and download when-you-need basis. Depending on regulatory requirements, banks can store these pdf / generate on-the-fly pdf up 7 to 10 yrs data.
This will reduce so-called 'complicated' pwd maintenance logic of dob/personal questions/cif/name letters +dob. Many info security teams from banks accept pwd-less in-app pdf and okay to send email about eStmt readiness, rather than pwd protected pdf.
If cust view that all his stmt available in app, he never opens pwd protected pdf. Practically Performance cannot be seen any issue here. 

Risk - if bank is sending my stmt to you and pwd is to save that scenario, then bank need solid estmt mgmt system. (good developers and smart info sec guy's.) üòâ
11/2/20, 20:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Why even send a statement?
11/2/20, 20:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Login & download when you need ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/2/20, 20:35 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Any unnecessary communication from bank is a potential phishing / fraud risk, these days!
11/2/20, 20:36 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What if a hacker sent you a email looking like a statement from bank? You would happily open the attachment & it could be a trojan or virus! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/2/20, 20:36 - Fintech DBS Amit Jadhav Digibank Sgd NnC: Neatly architected eStmt service can able to generate your savings / current acc stmt by 2nd day of new month (allow 1 day to process data.) for you to access via ib/mb. Notification shld be on your phone, every month 2nd eve. If not then banks 'digital' system needs improvements.
For cc n inv stmt, it can follow regular cycles. Plus provide ad-hoc stmt generation features. That's basic now a days.
11/2/20, 20:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: In this age of phishing & fraud by cloning, cloning an email is the easiest to do!
11/2/20, 20:37 - Fintech DBS Amit Jadhav Digibank Sgd NnC: Exactly. Access-on-need basis.

In general, this appears to be a genuine concern of a normal account holder who does not have transactions in his account which deserve privacy. But, there are several situations in which the account holder may need to prevent anyone other than himself from seeing the transactions. This can be true for Retired Pensioners who live with children or relatives that are keen to know his financial status and transactions. This could be true for a wife or husband undergoing a marital strife... There could be many such reasons for individual account holders. For corporate and business accounts the reasons are more obvious. Prior to digital era these were veritable problems as a pass book or a physical statement was almost impossible to secure. Physical files in businesses and corporates also presented unsurmountable  challenges. In a digital environment this has become easier to manage. So, enhancing privacy leveraging technology is a good step forward.
However, the manner of implementing passwords in estatements by  banks leaves a lot to be desired
1. The key to the password is embedded in the same mail as the one that carries it. In such a scenario, snoopers familiar with the person's personal data like name and date of birth (most prevalent data which is used in some combination or other) is easy to break... In a shared or networked  device ( many people still do not use a dedicated device) it still carries a risk of being compromised. So, there is a need to look into methods by which the password is implemented in such situations

Password is a Must
Security of Password too is a Must

This pertains to adding of a Dynamic QR code on all B2C invoices
11/3/20, 18:38 - Croma Maneesh Mittal Head e- Commerce NnR: My question is : from an ecom perspective,  wouldn't this cause problems for prepaid orders where payment is already collected? And similarly for COD orders where the customer makes payment using the QR code which effectively gets paid to the seller/market-place... leaving the courier hanging? will this not require significant changes in the courier integrations and operations as well,  in addition to just generating a QR code on the invoice?

*View 2* _Serial entrepreneur and founder of several large fintech & FIAKS Maven 2020 shared an article that helps in understanding the issue and possible repercussions globally following_ 

A. Regulators have long aimed to *curb the fast-growing online lending industry* to prevent systematic risks to the vast financial sector

B. Beijing has become more *uncomfortable with banks heavily using micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms* like Ant for underwriting consumer loans, amid fears of rising defaults and deteriorating asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.

C. China's central bank and banking regulator separately published draft micro-lending rules on Monday which seek to increase the bar for micro-lenders to be able to provide online loans directly to consumers or jointly with banks, while limiting the amount they can lend.

The draft, open for public feedback until Dec. 2, *requires small online lenders to provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks*, which is widely considered to be a key rule that will hurt the profitability of Ant's current business model.

That's really strange - how will the TPAPs achieve a reduction below 30% of the total?

*Solution* : Divide the company. Their would be another WS Retail somewhere

*FAB query: what is WS*
One of the leading sellers of Indian ecommerce WS Retail has reportedly stopped selling on its former-parent marketplace Flipkart.Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded WS Retails and later sold it to investors. Earlier, WS Retail was Flipkart‚Äôs in-house vendor and used to generate a bulk of its revenue before Flipkart turned into a marketplace.

It seems to be a very strange restriction... The sponsor banks have to enforce it, but how without the live volumes... My understanding from this is that the expectation is to restrict the monthly numbers of any TPAP to 30% of the last 3 months average of the total transactions...

11/6/20, 11:14 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _FIAKS Bespoke_: *Does The Farm Bill Actually Encourage Free Market Concept?*
The new bills will take away the exclusivity, which APMC‚Äôs currently enjoy over the purchase of farmers‚Äô produce. There is an established chain of market intermediaries, who are terribly unhappy with this. 

Small and marginal farmers are those who get affected due to unfavorable prices in the market. Now they will have an opportunity to sell where the price is favorable. But can he take it to that favorable market? Can he afford transportation? If he can afford, will it be a favorable price for his quantity of produce? He still will sell to the aggregator (middleman) who will sell it in a favorable market. It doesn‚Äôt seem there will be many benefits to the intended section of farmers. _*The bills can serve its purpose only if the ‚Äúfree market concept‚Äù is practiced in reality.*_

*CXO from Large Insurance* on FIAKS Post says 

The situation is getting dangerous now. How long can global trade be stopped. Consumption is also slowing people are risk averse. The entire economy slows down this way. The later it start chugging the more time it will take to reach the same speed and this will cause damages in the way. Difficult times for developed economies. 

*CXO lawyer* on SEBI post in India top trending news says 

How does Sebi  monitor the audit reports audited accounts etc that are shared with them mandatorarily under law but yet public companies go bust overnight....what is the point of such monitoring and transparency. Is it just for the sake of filing and transparency these reports are to be files with sebi..does sebi actually go thru the accounts and analyze whether its true and factual..

11/10/20, 00:03 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on CCI Ordering investigation GOOGLE INDIA_ 

He says 

what is the issue here....CCI steps in for Google taking advantage of its dominant position...is there any alternative who is being marginalized by a dominant player in *android phones*...does Net Neutrality  also trigger discussion on competition law and if yes what steps have been taken by CCI....pls  note net Neutrality debate overlaps with competition...
11/10/20, 00:39 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Some might think this will embolden Indian entrepreneurs but I highly doubt that theory.
11/10/20, 00:44 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: it will embolden the indian bully, by subduing the international leader, even if he isnt so much of a bully! lol
11/10/20, 00:45 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: all these self-righteous laws in india only seem to apply to international players. its almost like competition law doesn't apply to local companies! üòè
11/10/20, 00:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: If any decision is seen to be driven by politico-economic agenda, especially in a young poor country, where continuation of law is a problem, it will lead to both capital as well as brain flight.
11/10/20, 00:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is incorrect understanding, these laws don‚Äôt favour broad spectrum Indian companies.
11/10/20, 00:59 - Fintech Aayush NnR: India is far away from being a business liberal country, as you can see from RBI diktats in many formats, but they are doing what they can in an environment not driven by clear direction.
11/10/20, 01:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: i know that, but i dont hear any hue and cry against indian companies dominating particular industries..
11/10/20, 01:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: google pay is a problem because its google pay.. 
same for the drama about whatsapp pay..
if other UPI apps dint need a "NPCI nod", why did Whatsapp pay require it?

11/10/20, 23:17 - +91 90233 89243: There isnt a privacy risk in auctioning,  with controlling services of a  personal phone, there is a privacy risk, since bank personnel will have access to that device.

UBI is referred to as Telematics insurance in the car insurance industry. Through the use of telematics technology, a plug-in device or a pre-installed network in a vehicle or through mobile applications, a range of data such as how the vehicle is driven, the speed of driving, distance, fuel consumption, harsh braking, etc is collected is sent to the insurance company which keeps a track of such data and offers you additional discounts based on how good you drive.

If you drive well these tracking apps can be very beneficial. *However, it does throw up the question of privacy* because they track all your trips, and overtime this information could become valuable enough to be shared with advertisers.

Community member who is  Founder says that  today  80% of my revenues are given by 20% of the customers. What should I do with these  80% of customers who are actually *expense* to me today? These 80% of customers are associated with my business since inception but today they are adding no value to the business. Should we get rid of them‚ùì

*View 59* former CEO of very large organisation says

The ratio will remain the same if you lose 80%. That will reduce the income. Think how you can increase the ratio to 25:75 and so on. There are many instances of businesses doing this kind of analysis and losing entire business. Don't lose customers. Think how to make them consume more of your products. For example a small change in price can increase turnover and increase the ratio

I had done an analysis of  a shop which had cotton and silk. Silk gave maximum profit but then people came to buy cotton but bought silk. When the shop moved to complete silk the customer foot print crashed and silk did not sell. Silk could not compete with other silk shops who had more varities

 The Pareto's rule applies to almost all businesses. We all would live to cherry pick our customers. But unfortunately, that will never be the case when dealing with the masses. This is where Customer Value Management comes in, on how we can continue to retain our High Value customers, while trying to enhance the revenues coming from Low and Mid Value customers. Growing revenues from LVC and MVC customers is always tough and almost always entails more costs in the short term. The principle usually is Much More for More, i.e for a little extra fee, you give away disproportionately higher value of service for a certain period of time.. hoping that the customers will get used to / habituated to the service ir see value in it and subscribe to it permanently. The other way and a slightly risky one too is to *identify your bottom 10% customers  and to gradually downgrade the Quality of service being offered to them. Many service providers may even go to an extent of actually giving them a poorer user experience, hoping that they leave*..
Both the approaches work and may be chosen based on ones risk appetite and principles of business.

while microsoft warns against compromise on SMS OTP, it does say in the same document that it is better to use SMS than nothing.

*View CXO* on wallet portability (Every time I leave my job...my salary account changes..i need to add new billers. Here is the fintech idea from thought leader)

I was imagining....I have wallet in Mobikwik...I have done several transactions thru it for utility bills, payment to vendors and may be e-commerce purchase...I have record of transactions ID in mobikwik...for some reason I chose to shift to paytm (for eg better deals or wider acceptance or better service or information security etc etc etc)....I want to remove mobikwik from my apps becoz no point keeping a fintech app which has my  info plus access requirements like passwords to be remembered...basically simplify n consolidate wallets into for eg paytm...now to ensure i have my transaction history of mobikwik plus reminders of utility bills credit cards bills etc automatically migrated n integrated with paytm to ensure I continue to have all transaction history as well as data of my utility reminders etc .....not sure if this is something  which will be something people will luk forward for üòèü•¥

When no funding, priority is to make a profit, to grow. 

When you take VC money, priority is to increase valuation for a bigger round of funding, to survive!

11/20/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 100*

The Top 3 Private Pandemic Relief Donors, as of April 2020, are:

*No.1*
Jack Dorseyüá∫üá≤ ($1 billion)

*No.2*
Bill & Melinda Gates üá∫üá≤ ($255 million)

*No.3*
Azim Premji üáÆüá≥ ($132 million)

As reported by Forbes, Jack Dorsey has emerged as the most generous giver so far, after announcing on April 7 that he was moving $1 billion of his Square stock into an LLC to support COVID-19 relief efforts and other causes. It‚Äôs unclear how much of this $1 billion will go toward the coronavirus pandemic (so far he has given out about $5 million combined to four organizations), but even if it ends up being just 20% of his pledge, he will still have far outspent his peers. 

The second-largest pledge comes from Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, whose foundation has committed $305 million, much of it to be spent on vaccines, treatment and diagnostic development.

Indian tech magnate Azim Premji comes in third, planning to give $132 million to humanitarian aid and health interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19.

11/22/20, 12:51 - Vikas Business Phone: FIAKS community member says outage has   *unreported story* too.. Why should *ICICI bank cards* or *Citi bank cards* also fail while Amex Card be successful. What's the connection here? 

*Q1* How can  bank guarantee a customer that his balance in the account of say 100000 not become 000001. Do they understand infosys or oracle or TCS core banking system. Who controls the  black box ie  *algorithm*.... banker or tech company? 

*Q2* Are these tech companies made accountable for such outages?

*Q3* Do we need to rethink the *NUE*  initiative by regulators as with that logic NUE is required for SBI, ICICI, HDFC PNB Banks as they are too big an organisation compared to NPCI. 

*Q4* Is Digital strategy of the banks on right track? How are the banks ensuring that  fundamental are right or is it  driven by VC or PE invested companies?

11/22/20, 13:12 - RIL Chitti Babu Jio Money Reliance Digital Payments, Ii: Great and very relevant questions.

On the Amex card alone being successful, one logical reason could be that since it operates more like a closed loop program.
11/22/20, 13:39 - Vikas Business Phone: *Intellectual Speaks: FIAKS community thought leaders on Bank outage says*

*View 82* _Mr Vijay Shekhar Sharma founder Paytm and FIAKS Maven_

Too many point of failures in a system. These too many points are created to build open and multi party participation. So a system which is mash of diverse scope by multiple parties and multiple tech providers is defiantly going to have some outages. I believe it requires even *bigger commitment by key players* to keep system up and running. I think it is one of and shouldn‚Äôt be looked at as grave issue. Every bank / company wants to serve their customers so they will protect and build next level of scale too. Cheers,

*View 87*  _CTO of large fund house and FIAKS Maven says_
*On Amex*
 Amex is using a separate network / switch and is not through MASTERCARD/VISA While the POS could be the same, connectivity is separate. Don‚Äôt have the details of what exactly went wrong, but it would not have impacted the Amex network/switch

*A4: Digital Strategy* : in my view, digital for banks is mainly catch-up to startups and fintechs. I haven‚Äôt seen enough focus on making the backend robust and STP.

*A1: On Algorithms* algo is written by the tech companies as specified by banks. Banks carry out thorough testing. Banks are responsible to the customer

*A2* usually banks have SLA and penalty clauses. How many cases they recover, it all depends.However rarely have I seen it passed on to the customer who is actually the most impacted party

11/22/20, 17:25 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectuals Speak: Community thought leader & FIAKS  MAVEN founder of HAPPY *Mr Manish Khera* on the current  discussions *supports Banks for it Digital Strategy*_

He says you need to understand difference between the Banks & Fintech. And you will realise that banks digital strategy is absolutely *correct*. Let me share some details 

*FINTECH*
Fintech‚Äôs earlier called non banks is (unregulated) do innovation for customer gain with tech ownership and they take risk and scale through market forces. They can take risk ...hence they are innovative. However as the fintech becomes big...regulation kicks in and they are forced to do partnership with banks (like in case of wallet) and then conversion to license / regulation 

On the other hand *BANKS*
Banking is Businesss run on regulatory compliance with outsourced tech. To maintain leadership they do partnerships with Fintech while managing regulatory need.. this is the way they are managing customer scale. Please understand *Expecting banks to be innovative is wrong* and with so many regulatory constraints they are still trying their best hence all the banks digital strategy is correct 

Regulator was created 100 years back since banks were allowed to handle public money and distributed ownership and professional / employee run rather than promoter run business was the design. The design inherently slows / kills innovation. 

With very very recent reversal of view to back to promoter / private sector ownership we may be able to change it though the objective both from policy makers and private sector for this change seem to be different as of now

11/25/20, 21:22 - Vikas Business Phone: Intellectual Speaks: FIAKS Community Thought Leader present contrarian view *ENTRY OF CORPORATE INTO BANKING*

*View (3 out 84) - CXO*
( _We recommends this CXO to be consider for CEO in the new venture or as a Board Member by Top *Founders* in the community. FIAKS will try to set-up an informal meeting with you if FIAKS Maven agrees_)

He says 

I have a contrarian view on this. 
We can extol the virtue of a model only if it has been reasonably successful in the past.  *Banks sans corporate promoters have not in any way reduced the risk of collusion between banks and corporates either in India or anywhere else*.  If anything, it has worsened the collusion by making banks vulnerable to the charms of not one but several corporates.  When quite a few banks have died and many more have gone through near death experience despite  some of them being owned by Govt itself (the anti thesis of corporate ), why assume corporates promoting banks would spell further disaster. 

Today banking across the world has become *oligopolistic mainly because of huge  entry barriers*. This has in turn resulted in too big to fail banks  regulatory forbearance and bailouts. Further such *large banks tend to favor large corporations at the cost  of SMEs*  and other marginal borrowers. *What we really need is an ecosystem comprising  banks small enough to fail but big enough to be competitive*. We can have a few very large global banks that are tightly regulated and ring fenced from retail depositors, but a larger body of our financial system should comprise mid-sized banks that do vanilla commercial banking.  An efficient way to develop such eco system is by giving out more licences to strong corporate promoters with known track-record instead of shutting them out from banking scene (I prefer licence on auction at periodic intervals, a la telecom). Along with freeing up the licencing the regulator should shift their objective  from bank protection to banking system and depositor protection. This can be achieved by stipulating higher liquidity ratio for retail deposits and making retail deposits senior to other forms of debt and allowing orderly demise of inefficient players. There should be a well defined rule triggered process for takeover of weaker banks by an apex entity (IBA) for orderly wind down without inconveniencing retail depositors. Locking the stadium gate and not allowing new players to enter is lazy refereeing. It makes those who are inside the stadium complacent if not arrogant. Bank shares are so abnormally high priced to book value only because of this 'inside stadium' advantage.

Further the current entry barriers in banking has given rise to a parallel financial sector of shadow banks and NBFCs that ultimately dip into banks' coffers for fuelling their growth.  creating additional systemic risks. It is better to transform these nbfcs to non retail banks instead of allowing them to take down a bank on their way down. 

To sum up it will be advisable to bifurcate bank as follows 
1. Large Financial conglomerates.
2. Full scale commercial banks (vanilla commercial  banking entities)

3. Retail Banks (only retail deposits and retail +SME loans) 
4. Non retail commercial Banks (where no retail deposits are taken). and liquidity prescriptions and regulatory oversight should ease proportionately from 1 to 4.   
Proper ring fencing of banks in different rungs should be ensured to avoid cross  contamination of systemic risks from higher rung to lower rung banks. Ownership will become least of our worries if we can develop a graded financial system with rule based regulations that allows risk takers to flourish or fail while insulating risk averse depositors from such failures

11/27/20, 01:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Haha that‚Äôs too much praise.
See the point is simple - Whatever has theoretical zero marginal cost of production / distribution will be sold at zero cost or negative cost, while trying to find other ways of monetising the user or transacted information.

This is just economics - All prices which can be zero will be zero.

Don‚Äôt fight economics or physics as first principle, you won‚Äôt win.
11/27/20, 01:08 - Vikas Business Phone: Heavy.. Will read in the morning üôèüèª
11/27/20, 06:16 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: I still find this ludicrous to begin with. 

0% MDR is neither the end goal nor an outcome anyone wants. 

In a digital transaction, where the switch makes nothing, the banks earns nothing, the customer or the merchant pays nothing is neither sustainable or healthy for an ecosystem! 

Businesses are ‚Äúmeant to‚Äù run for profits and not charity.
11/27/20, 06:18 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: This is a populist move by paytm in trying hard to keep the wallet alive in trying to fight UPI and give its wallet some traction.
11/27/20, 06:28 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Economics and literature are slightly different üòú

Please tell me any lasting business which works on 0 fee and 0 profit - together. 

The only exception (part, not ful - since even google charges) is businesses like Google which charge charge 0 for some services. 

But please remember when you dont pay for the product, you are the product! 
Companies will end up monetising marketing your data to pay paychecks!  

All this said, 0 fees, offers, incentives - is good to get consumers, change habits, and show vanity metrics - but when sanity dawns, companies  create commerical models to make ‚Äúeconomics‚Äù work!!
11/27/20, 06:31 - Fintech Aayush NnR: When did I deny any of this? üòú
My bet exists because people want to win at any cost and therefore are ok with creating something called as dead weight loss in economics, in a hope to win all strategy. It doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt mean people will stop trying - Therefore what can tend to zero will become zero or even negative, just because the hope exists.
11/27/20, 06:41 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: I agree. Zero MDR is not sustainable. By that logic Visa / MC / Rupay have to compensate card acquirer and still pay 100% of sale value to merchant, ignoring cost of processing and cost of fraud. Fail to see how this can work.
11/27/20, 06:43 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Public vs Private vs Tech
11/27/20, 06:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Your margin is someone‚Äôs opportunity for either much higher multiple or much higher valuation
11/27/20, 06:45 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Public non-tech companies can‚Äôt play this game, tech can because of information and multiple, and private can because they are ok to take a hit to acquire metrics
11/27/20, 06:55 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Taking hit for metrics is only short term. If we see that aside for a moment, it‚Äôs unviable outside that short term goal. Information can be monetized but at scale you cannot generate more money at scale by adding information to money. 

If at all this was to prevail then we‚Äôre setting the stage for GAFAs of the world to dominate.

11/27/20, 07:14 - +91 90233 89243: Very few I guess.
11/27/20, 07:16 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Exactly my point. These moves are not strategic. Knee jerk to fight UPI which is vain
11/27/20, 07:18 - +91 90233 89243: Wallets still make sense when it comes to user experience, most UPI apps have multiple hops untill the payment is done, while wallets have lesser.
11/27/20, 07:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Marginally better.. tho, having to hold separate balance, is a huge negative..
11/27/20, 07:20 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Besides, if 2FA is enforced for wallets, that advantage is also lost..
11/27/20, 07:23 - +91 90233 89243: 2FA is kind of there wid upi as well, 2 6 digit PIN to remember, eventually everyone ends us using same PIN for both..

11/27/20, 07:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
11/27/20, 07:28 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. I meant to say, wallet UX was better because of lack of 2FA.

11/27/20, 07:53 - +91 90233 89243: Wallets like phonepe etc are now becoming shareholders in NPCI
11/27/20, 07:57 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Btw there is nothing that stops an ITTP like - link and pay experience on UPI. I am sure some Fintechs are already thinking of it
11/27/20, 07:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: BHIM sends a SMS, but it always made me wonder why they dint do a click to pay link? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You had to manually open the app even after seeing the SMS!

11/27/20, 08:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
11/27/20, 08:01 - +91 90233 89243: Linking is one thing and redirection is other. If UPI can allow integrated experience , that may do the trick.
11/27/20, 08:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Is use of app to authenticate UPI pin mandatory? Cant it be done via browser hosted by the app itself?
11/27/20, 08:03 - +91 90233 89243: need not be a browser, it has to be SDKs that can integrate natively
11/27/20, 08:05 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I meant other way around.. lets say u enter ur bhim vpa in BSNL website..

Typically, u open BHIM app to approve the payment by entering pin.. instead, can BHIM not host a web page for same purpose?

If not, atleast they can send a link which opens the app?
11/27/20, 08:07 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: say https://bhim.in?txn=1234 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/27/20, 08:07 - +91 90233 89243: easily possible, atleast to open app
11/27/20, 08:07 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Which is why I ITTP like + link n pay
11/27/20, 08:07 - +91 90233 89243: may be its because its BSNL üôÇ
11/27/20, 08:09 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: No no. The sms has nothing to do with merchant. The BHIM sms is sent by NPCI
11/27/20, 08:11 - +91 90233 89243: I meant, the code for opening up UPI apps via Web is easily doable, may be BSNL might not know this.
11/27/20, 08:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: That may not help.. u may not be making the payment on the mobile..
11/27/20, 08:22 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Sms auth should be changed to web Https - upi sms today is the biggest vent for fraud

11/27/20, 16:04 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 1*

An avid fan of British period pieces might immediately associate the name of the manufacturer of the fastest car with the Netflix series 'Peaky Blinders'
11/27/20, 16:37 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 2*

11/27/20, 17:23 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *Hint 3*

No two of the three fastest cars are owned by the same manufacturer but,  
*2 of the Manufactures are based in USA.*
11/27/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 101*

The Fastest Production Cars in the world as of October 2020 are:

*No.1*
SSC Tuatara 
(509 kmph)

*No.2*
Bugatti Chiron 
(490 kmph)

*No.3*
M2K Motorsports Ford GT 
(483 kmph)

The Tuatara is a hypercar unlike any other. It is the culmination of over a decade of research and development to produce a road legal, high performance vehicle capable of delivering an otherworldly driving experience. Influenced by fighter jet aerodynamics and performance, the presence of the Tuatara inspires a sense of both intensity and simplistic design. Its striking profile is futuristic in its function, yet timeless in its form.

With the Tuatara, the US car manufacturer Shelby SuperCars (SSC) has broken the speed record for a production car. Over a distance of approximately eleven kilometers, the sports car achieved an average speed of 509 kilometers per hour.

The SCC Tuatura is the first of the Supercars to break the 500kmph barrier. At its fastest, the car even reached 533 kmph!
11/27/20, 18:44 - +91 90233 89243: Sonething to ponder on, can therd be a feature like stop wallet payments analogous to stop cheque??
11/27/20, 18:44 - +91 90233 89243: *can there be
11/27/20, 18:49 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Compared to physical cheques, Dont you think the instant nature of digi payments leaves limited scope; unless there was recurring / scheduled payments.
11/27/20, 18:50 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: But i feel that digital payments need to have the ability to dispute charges just likem credit cards!
11/27/20, 19:03 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: Congratulations you got two answers correct !!üëç
11/27/20, 19:04 - +91 90233 89243: This might sound a bit overwhelming, however only way to improve the customer service in India is to link payments with customer satisfaction [ with AI and other tech coming up I think its doable to an extent] especially when you have prepaid , just for an example MNO promising 4G and giving 3G speeds. I as a consumer has a proof of speed, but I cannot retract my payments that are already made.

Honestly I feel that 1% bank tech failure for a payment system is also very high. Financial products should be at 99.5% success rates. I don‚Äôt think people even accept anything less than 97% failure upfront. Anything less than six sigma for payments product is low nevertheless. But I guess the other funnel related to user experience especially on bank apps doing UPI is a big area crying for improvement.

12/1/20, 18:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Well.. but conflict of interest, for PSPs. 

Our Use case; An e-com platform that allows p2p upi payment from customer to merchant. Either push or pull.

Is there any way to do that without a PSP & a way for the platform to be updated of the payment transaction?
12/1/20, 18:13 - +91 90233 89243: Its p2m, right?

12/1/20, 18:14 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Technically, is p2m

But if you pay a shop keepers vpa from ur upi app, is that really p2m or p2p?

12/1/20, 18:17 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: *BHIM QR Code

12/1/20, 18:24 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Not unless you tie up with a bank / PSP.

12/1/20, 18:27 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Typically, this should be easy in an open banking api / architecture, but what is the status with that in India, wrt UPI?
12/1/20, 18:28 - Aditya Birla Piush Kothari Payment Bank NnR: Merchant KYC, settlement account, etc. required
12/1/20, 18:29 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Why? It‚Äôs going to his verified bank account. ü§î

12/1/20, 18:37 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It feels like we are defeating the purpose of UPI, by forcing merchants to use an acquirer who is aggregating his funds, before settling his payments..
12/1/20, 18:38 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Give it time
12/1/20, 18:39 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Patience not one of my virtues! ü§™

I would like to take an initiative, even if its a long shot!
12/1/20, 18:41 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Why have an acquirer as middle man for a p2p payment system?

The irony of it! üòè
12/1/20, 18:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: All transaction cost will tend to zero
12/1/20, 18:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Doesn‚Äôt matter which player what country
12/1/20, 18:42 - Fintech Aayush NnR: It‚Äôs just about time
12/1/20, 18:43 - Freecharge Ishan Vaish Director Of Product NnR: Very valid. You should write to Praveena
12/1/20, 18:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Yes. But why use resources of a gateway / acquirer, to do a p2p transaction, at 0 MDR?
12/1/20, 18:43 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Can do! Contact?
12/1/20, 18:44 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Give it time

12/1/20, 18:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Sir kya aap sir yeh sab puch rahe hain
12/1/20, 18:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because none of them want to show a transaction, the shop keeper definitely not
12/1/20, 18:57 - Fintech Aayush NnR: This is half the reason why UPI isn‚Äôt even bigger

12/1/20, 18:58 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: That‚Äôs the oxymoron here!

Unless routed through a acquirer / ‚Äúmerchant account‚Äù, it‚Äôs considered p2p, right?
12/1/20, 18:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
12/1/20, 18:59 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: As in, if store owner prints his own BHIM QR code, and customer pays him by scanning that, it‚Äôs actually person 2 merchant, but technically p2p?
12/1/20, 19:00 - Rediff Parag Chivte VP. IIR: <Media omitted>
12/1/20, 19:00 - +91 90233 89243: Yea, i do this
12/1/20, 19:00 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Exactly. Then, to do this online with an API, why do you need an ‚Äúacquirer‚Äù & merchant account?
12/1/20, 19:00 - +91 90233 89243: But like I use to pay to this local tea sellet
12/1/20, 19:01 - +91 90233 89243: *seller
12/1/20, 19:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: So, do you classify that as p2p or p2m?
12/1/20, 19:01 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: If you can pay to tea seller like that, why should it be more complicated to pay a bigger merchant?
12/1/20, 19:02 - +91 90233 89243: P2P, if they are not onboatded as a merchant. P2M if they are as a onboarded as a merchant.
12/1/20, 19:03 - +91 90233 89243: Except what Ayush mentioned what is the motivation of bigger merchant accepting p2p?
12/1/20, 19:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Exactly my point. Why?

In case of cards, theres a risk profile & acquirer risk involved.

Here, none of that applies. Then, why does PSP need to route payments through them and delay settlement by a day or 2? Why not settle direct from customer to merchant?
12/1/20, 19:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Which merchant likes acquirer holding onto his money for a day or 2? Or charging a fee?
12/1/20, 19:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: None
12/1/20, 19:07 - +91 90233 89243: valid
12/1/20, 19:07 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Perhaps non person accounting but not many people give a flying to that
12/1/20, 19:08 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Any merchant with a UPI app can request a pyment from a customer. Right?

Then, why is it so complicated to do it from his website?
12/1/20, 19:10 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: To add to this..

Any merchant with a UPI app can request a pyment from a customer. He gets his payment instantly. Right?

Then, why is it so complicated to do it from his website? Why does an acquirer need to aggregate & settle late & charge a fee?

Why not an API where funds go directly from customer account to merchant account, especially since MDR is 0?
12/1/20, 19:11 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Because people who have websites are rich people
12/1/20, 19:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: And to make this a feasible integration, the website / platform should have an API which can pull transaction status of the order too
12/1/20, 19:11 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: <Media omitted>
12/1/20, 19:12 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: It‚Äôs probably conflict of interest for NPCI shareholders if NPCI allows such an integration flow! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/1/20, 19:12 - Fintech Aayush NnR: And rich must be guillotined.
12/1/20, 19:13 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Honestly. I can‚Äôt think of another reason as to why UPI needs an acquirer who aggregates!
12/1/20, 19:14 - +91 90233 89243: Dont think so they need, are there any restrictions on current account using UPI pet se?
12/1/20, 19:14 - +91 90233 89243: *per se
12/1/20, 19:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: What API allows direct transfer from customer to merchant?
12/1/20, 19:15 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Two head rolls and better than one head roll
12/1/20, 19:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: That was my original question, in fact! ü§î
12/1/20, 19:16 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Almost any PSP that provides UPI API to merchants, accept customer payment to their own VPAs / accounts & then settles to merchant after a day or 2. Why?
12/1/20, 19:22 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I have a simple requirement. 

I want an API to allow merchant website to request payment from customer, and settle merchant directly from customer account. And be able to track the progress of the transaction.
12/1/20, 19:23 - +91 90233 89243: We only do complex things üòâ

12/1/20, 19:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
12/1/20, 19:31 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: The way I understand the current process, the only way to do it now is to tie up with a bank for an arrangement similar to say PhonePe or google pay, for my e-com platform. Then, merchant needs to be provided a new VPA by my app acting as an upi app. Once we do that, I can initiate a payment from the customer on checkout using this vpa.
12/1/20, 19:34 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Is this correct?
is there any easier way?

_Upi sucks big time in PGs. Most people are plain happy doing p2p trf to friends and getting gung ho about the new toy in town but the P2M story , specially for payments initiated at merchant end is sadly, totally different..._

*On Biodegradable credit card*
_With contactless transactions and card not present transactions increasing over the ones where cards get the wear and tear, why not investing in *increasing expiry date of the same card* and issue new only if customer asks for? Basically, increasing validity of the same card and hence reduce usage of ANY material being used._

*On New Google Pay*
_While reading the article, it took a while to adapt to the fact that this article is focusing on non-Indians and to us all this is fairly obvious. Towards the end, they talk about their success with Tez in India and how that has been a stepping stone to this.Their headline claim in this article is sadly not available in India properly. I am *not able* to pay somebody in my contact book using google pay seamlessly. A very simple feature and something that has been available on Paytm- google pay has not done it right. Try paying somebody from your payment book and if the name of your contact matches the name in the google system, it will work, else will not. They are not using the phone number as the primary field to identify to who the payment shd go. Surprising, unless I am making some mistake in executing it._

12/3/20, 01:15 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks: FIAKS MAVEN 2020 & CXO  shares this thought on NEW GOOGLE PAY. He is unable to pay somebody using NEW GOOGLE PAY using contact but this feature is enabled very simple way by PAYTM_
He gives an example as under 

*Pic 1* Let me explain this with an example. I have a good friend by the name of Abhixxx Daxxxx. As he is my close friend, I call him DG and have stored his name in my contact book as *DG*. Abhichar / DG is enabled on google pay (obviously under his formal name Abhixxx Daxxxx)  and I need to pay him some money. Simple, I go to google pay and pull him up from my contact book by typing DG. Looks simple but does not work! *No DG is found in google pay and I cannot progress further*.

*Pic 2&3* : But DG is there in my address with the proper phone number, however google pay cannot find it because it is searching on name. 
Now, think of situations in real life when you pay - how often do the names you have match with the payment registered name in the google database. In my experience rarely, maybe 20% of the time. My newspaper guy is Virdhe but the google pay number he gives is his wives etc

Google pay is more secure as it is doing a double check but *unnnecessary and inconvenient*, in my opinion.

*Pic 4* : To better explain I am also extracting screenshot of how Paytm extracts the payment detail using whatever name I have in my contact book irrespective of the name registered with them.

12/3/20, 17:55 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: With the SBI tech issues, HDFC being asked to pause new digital initiatives, and the failures on UPI, the question that begs asking is that has Indian banking tech got too far ahead of itself?

UPI type payments is not available even today in many first world countries. It could have been an ideal model to ‚Äúsell‚Äù to other countries (some limited efforts have been made I guess ). 

Ultimately it seems there is a gross lack of accountability in corporate IT in the banking sector. Blaming the vendor is even further proof of eschewing accountability within the bank. Amused and really sad to see this.
12/3/20, 17:55 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: In a way good for fintech - customers will trust banks even less if this trend continues
12/3/20, 17:56 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Yeah I agree

12/3/20, 17:58 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: well said, banking sector is completely depending on the vendor for every small tech requirements, Many bank's DIT wing accommodates more vendor manpower than bank's man power, they do only the price negotiation , nothing else,
12/3/20, 17:59 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Yeah exactly. Imagine a Paytm or Razorpay (Hi Shashank!) or Instamojo blaming someone else if God forbid there is a glitch in their system.
12/3/20, 18:01 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Job savers vs entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs will win.
12/3/20, 18:03 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Right, and this brings in the whole big question of checks and balances that cannot be outsourced. Even if they have outsourced it, the accountability remains 100% with the CIO, since outsourcing is only a means of achieving efficiency and not abdicating responsibility. Imagine if ....

- A bank gives a million dollars to be transported in cash
- The security agency to whom it outsourced, loses that money
- The bank comes back and tells the depositor that they lost the money because transporting it was someone else's responsibility., and says "We are in touch with ABC Security Agency and they are working on a resolution."

12/3/20, 18:09 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: I knew an incident in one of the prominent bank, they completely outsourced the recon to some vendor, that vendor staff and bank staff collaborated n diverted all the failure transactions to their Pvt accounts, bank could not trace it immediately, as normally those txns will be kept in the sundries, it took more than a year to find that fraud of 2.5 crores....both vendor n.bank are pointing to each other.....ü§£ü§£ü§£
12/3/20, 18:09 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Now bank want to do recon on their own, they are completely clueless...
12/3/20, 18:13 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Banking IT wing should hire young talents and groom them for their tech requirements, thay too get frustrated and become dumb guys over a period of time as they will be headed by some bankers outside the IT domain...
12/3/20, 18:13 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: It's the reality across the PSU banks
12/3/20, 18:15 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ
12/3/20, 18:17 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: True, and its not sufficient to just hold the CIO responsible. I would admit it's much more complex and staffing decisions and strategy goes up to the Board level, so the CIO cannot be the scapegoat. Who knows, the Board might have actually sanctioned naming and shaming of the vendor to shield themselves.
12/3/20, 18:18 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Seems more likely that was a CIO or lower level decision..

*Question 1* As part of *Audit check list* shouldn‚Äôt REGULATORY  AUDITOR just walk into any bank and switch-off the production servers for one month and ask IT teams of the bank to run the banking operation  on DR(disaster recovery) set-up? 

*Question 2* What % of banks will fail on this test of running the bank & all its products from DR site? 

*Question 3* What is the probability of success  of NPCI to operate all its products on DR set-up for one month?

*Question 4* Do you see quality of RBI officials doing bank audits gone down drastically.

12/3/20, 18:52 - +91 90233 89243: Why 1 month?
12/3/20, 18:53 - +91 90046 19987: In fact banks should look for Active-Active set up for better availability
12/3/20, 18:55 - Fintech Aayush NnR: Startup
12/3/20, 18:56 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Regular DR switchover is done at all banks and they run production workloads on DR for a reasonable time to test resilience. Agreed it is always a planned switch but also it‚Äôs rare for an entire data centre to go offline all of a sudden because of the failover design inbuilt in each component.
12/3/20, 18:57 - +91 90233 89243: Yeah and hence my question for 1 month, instead the frequency of tests should be increased
12/3/20, 18:57 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: Yes and many of them do I guess. I‚Äôve witnessed at least 2 large banks with this arrangement.
12/3/20, 18:57 - +91 90233 89243: Probably the cost is one of the factor
12/3/20, 18:57 - +91 90046 19987: As per my knowledge no bank in India has A-A across sites
12/3/20, 18:58 - +91 90046 19987: They have to choose between cost vs business & reputation loss üòâ
12/3/20, 18:59 - +91 90233 89243: I think platforms have active active arrangements but not popular among banks
12/3/20, 18:59 - Remitr Sandeep Todi Co-founder NnC: My information could be incomplete but I did see 100% switchover events
12/3/20, 19:01 - +91 90046 19987: Not in A-A , at least top 5-8 banks in India
12/3/20, 19:02 - +91 90233 89243: A good way for indian banks is to move to microservices model, however that's a huge undertaking
12/3/20, 19:03 - +91 90046 19987: On cloud you mean?
12/3/20, 19:04 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: üòÇ

12/3/20, 19:08 - +91 90233 89243: Yeah, thats why its a huge undertaking since it almost touches everything, but longer term it could benefit

Theoretically stimulating questions.

However, it must be remembered that banks typically have hundreds of systems, and only a handful can be seen as critical (e.g. customer facing), primarily basis their CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) requirements.

DR can be created at 100% capacity of the primary, or a smaller percentage thereof depending on the CIA values. A 100% DR for 100% systems is generally infeasible, both economically and operationally.

Next, regardless of the criticality, systems are interwoven. Which means that the theoretical-single-switch being pulled down in the DC will (theoretically) shift the identified critical systems to DR, for most part, but other systems (without a DR) would also go down with them. Needless to say, since the systems that are now in DR may lose connectivity to (some of) their dependant/ interwoven systems due to power down, it would be a bit difficult to predict the overall behaviour of the systems.

A better approach is to create an Active-Active setup between two sites ‚Äî that too has some other set of challenges ...

12/4/20, 18:05 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 102*

The countries with the largest decrease in their CO2 emissions, as of August 31, are:

*No.1*
Spainüá™üá∏ (-17.2%)

*No.2*
IndiaüáÆüá≥ (-13.4%)

*No.3*
U.S.A.üá∫üá∏ (-12.9%)

The largest contributor to this drop is the reduction in ground transport use - down 17 percent on 2019 and accounting for roughly half of the overall change. Of the individual countries for which data has been published, Spain has shown the largest decrease compared to 2019, as of August 31.

This data was calculated/estimated by Carbon Monitor. With businesses, manufacturing and transport picking, we as corporations and citizens should ensure that environment consciousness sticks with us beyond the pandemic and becomes a lifestyle.

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Norwegian deputy central bank governor Jon Nicolaisen announced that he was resigning on Friday, saying his application for renewed security clearance had been rejected because he has a Chinese wife.*
https://fiaks.com 

‚ñ™Ô∏è *While the economic turmoil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic has left some people in Britain counting every penny, the country‚Äôs central bank is apparently having trouble keeping track of billions of pounds.A parliamentary report released on Friday said that 50 billion pounds (about $67 billion) of paper money is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù from the country‚Äôs cash supply and that the Bank of England ‚Äúseems to lack curiosity‚Äù about where it‚Äôs all gone.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Singapore issues four digital bank licences holds back on one Alibaba‚Äôs Ant Group and joint bidders Grab and Singtel are amongst bidders that have snagged licences to offer digital banking services in the country targeted to commence early-2022 though, the four issued is one short of the initial target of five.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Demand for new cars in the UK was in November was nearly 30% below the same month last year, as the second national lockdown put a dampener on sales. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said just 113,781 new registrations were recorded in the UK, nearly 43,000 or 27.4% fewer than during November 2019. Trade has not been this poor since the 2008 recession.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *More than 8,000 expatriate children in Kuwait are now violating the residency rules because of the failure of their relatives to register them after birth, placing them in the category of unknown status, Al Rai daily reported, quoting informed security sources.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *The Facebook fronted stablecoin, Diem (formerly Libra)‚Äôs dismal testnet results undercut the assertion that the digital currency is a threat to global financial stability. This is the conclusion that can be deduced from a Diem blockchain explorer update which shows the network only processes an average of six transactions per second (tps), with the highest reported figure of 24 tps. The testnet for Diem has been live for more than 43 days at the time of writing.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Lufthansa will have shed 29,000 staff by the end of the year and the German airline will cut another 10,000 jobs in its home country next year as it struggles to cope with the coronavirus, a newspaper reported on Sunday.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *One of Australia's wealthiest families is locked in a bitter legal dispute over a multibillion-dollar estate - as daughter claims she was left out of will because she was artificially inseminated*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Israeli companies are expected to invest in various UAE sectors to the tune of $500 million (Dh1.835 billion), said Dr Fahed Al Meraabi, chairman and chief executive of Zurich Capital Funds.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *China‚Äôs second largest online retailer JD dot)com has become the country‚Äôs first e-commerce platform to accept the digital yuan, a cryptocurrency supported by China‚Äôs central bank. JD Digits, the company‚Äôs fintech branch, will launch a pilot program later this month*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Sometimes, success can be devastating.Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that UPS failed to deliver nearly one in 10 packages on time last week. Worse, the Journal said the struggling company has ordered its drivers to stop picking up packages at six of the nation‚Äôs largest retailers: Macy‚Äôs Inc., Gap Inc., L.L. Bean Inc., Nike Inc., Newegg Inc. and Hot Topic Inc. until further notice.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Shops reluctant to accept cash due to Covid leave people struggling to pay. Bridget Phillipson, MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, highlighted the problem in the House of Commons. She said: "There are still about 1 million people in the UK without a bank account and some older, lower-income households that rely on cash to budget or because of a lack of access to online banking.*

‚ñ™Ô∏è *7-Eleven, the largest chain of convenience stores in the U.S., launched its new mobile wallet. Customers can access the mobile wallet within the 7-Eleven app and use it for purchases within the chain‚Äôs U.S. stores, as well as 7-Eleven branded gas stations.*

View 7: Founder 

_If Credit/ debit card, Net Banking, UPI, IMPS or ATM card can all be used to top up your wallet.So don't see how and why we can't also use UPI QR to debit from the   wallet. But then, can one  use NET BANKING to debit your wallet_  ü§î.

*View 11* CXO Banker 
_Well, technically why not! After all currency in digital format can stay in a bank account or in a wallet, it‚Äôs all the same.But one situation I envisage is that this might then be used as a back channel for wallet-to-wallet transfer. This isn‚Äôt permitted I guess, since wallets are semi-kyc instruments still.Other than that, it‚Äôs like transmission media are generally independent of the content type they want to transmit! üòå_

BC has to be fed with cash. Kiranas rotate their own cash.  So cash management becomes. Simpler, efficient and scalable. Just to compare further with the ATM.  Zero capital costs.  You amortize the capital cost and pay off the kiranas. Still you will be breaking even faster


*Policy Advocacy Question* Can retail cash be used for micro ATM payouts, without being accounted for via a bank deposit?,Same is not allowed in WLA ATM's,

If you *outsource* the pizza base, you *lose control and taste* of the Pizza. 

Tech for a startup is exactly that!Outsourced tech only gives you lack of control, in-agility and no handle on the user experience! 

One of the main reasons why you banks are where they are!!

Community member is asking
NPCI (UPI) 86% = Google Pay 45% + PhonePe 41% (for Nov) 

Isn‚Äôt something is incorrect.. he raises a question as under:

*Question 1* Are *high failure of NPCI*  rates designed to make other entities at disadvantage 

*Question 2* What happens to NPCI if these two companies *launch NUE entity of their own*. NPCI transaction count will be only 14%.  üôÉ

*Question 3*  If funding to these two companies stop. What happens to transaction count. *Are these two companies (Google Pay& Phone Pe) profitable*? 

*Question 4* Bank product offering are equally good.. why are they not getting transactions? Banks have restrictions on payouts for *promotion up Rs 250/-* . What about these two companies? Are regulators checking their marketing spends ü§î

12/10/20, 09:09 - Wechat Nilay Arora IiNC: If I remember correctly somewhere, RBI‚Äôs mandate to NPCI was Digital Payments should be public good. While NPCI has done a great job over the years under that mandate, I think eventually the overhead of operating such large and fast growing system alone is getting to them. To my mind NUE = Share the NPCI burden. Hence do everything NPCI does, fully interoperable with existing NPCI system, keep banks in the loop (no walled garden without banks) + more, but under close watch of RBI. All entity therefore might coexist. May be somewhat like Telcos with DoT (with DoT operating BSNL).

12/11/20, 18:03 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 103*

The world's 3 richest families & their 2020 networth (in USD):

*No.1*
Walton üá∫üá∏
Company: Walmart
Networth: $215 billion

*No.2*
Mars üá∫üá∏
Company: Mars, Inc. 
Networth: $120 billion

*No.3*
Koch üá∫üá∏
Company: Koch Industries, Inc.
Networth: $109.7 billion

*Rankings from 4-10 are as follows:*

4. Al Saud üá∏üá¶ - $95 billion
5. Ambani üáÆüá≥ - $81.3 billion
6. Herm√®süá´üá∑ - $63.9 billion
7. Wertheimer üá´üá∑- $54.4 billion
8. Johnsonüá∫üá∏ -$46.3 billion
9. Boehringer, Von Baumbach üá©üá™- $45.7 billion
10. Albrecht üá©üá™ - $41 billion

The COVID-19 pandemic hasn‚Äôt stopped the world‚Äôs wealthiest families from growing their fortunes. Over the past year, the richest family‚Äîthe Waltons‚Äîgrew their wealth by $25 billion, or almost $3 million per hour! 

However, not everyone on the list has been thriving this year. The Koch family‚Äôs fortune dropped by $15 billion from 2019 to 2020

While intergenerational family wealth is comparatively resilient against market upheavals and recessions and the like, 
2021 rankings might reflect the effect of the changing global scenario.

As companies like Google who has no dearth of money and compute resources (literally unlimited even though technically it is not), still they are going down, some lessons for us to prepare in the next level.

*FAB Query* WHAT IS DDOS ?
 _In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source_.

_A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade._

12/16/20, 14:33 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: Hi All,

Had a query...

Currently am using a closed loop card from Sodexo for gifting   to customers, which can be utulised at only at specific locations by whitelisting of specific MIDs and TIDs.

A similar service is also offered  by Paytm, where in a Special Allowance Wallet is created within the Paytm wallet and the gift amount can be credited into the same account and utilised at specific merchants only..

While the Paytm Special Allowance Wallet is functioning smoothly, the acceptance in upcountry markets and merchants is a concern..

Whereas my experience of  using Sodexo hasnt been too good, due to multiple customer issues and complicated processes.

Are there any other banks or other providers who provide a close looped physical card for gifting?
12/16/20, 14:39 - +65 9172 8895: HDFC used to have prepaid gift cards
12/16/20, 14:47 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: are you referring to gift cards or food cards?
12/16/20, 15:00 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: No.. these arent gift cards..
Need to use the cards as fuel cards.. However, need to be able tonuse them only at specific Petrol /CNG stations only.. and not at any other merchant..
12/16/20, 15:01 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: The prepaid gift cards are open and the money can be used for any transaction at any vendor.. whereas i am looking to restrict thebusage at specific merchants only.
12/16/20, 15:06 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I guess they already have these 2 categories..
food cards restricted to food & supermarkets/groceries..
And fuel cards restricted to fuel stations
12/16/20, 15:07 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Not sure you can restrict to specific fuel stations.. ü§î

Unless it‚Äôs a prepaid card is issued by the fuel brand..

12/16/20, 17:30 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Food cards are restricted to restaurants/supermarkets only
12/16/20, 17:30 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Unless that fuel merchant configured as super market
12/16/20, 17:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Are you looking for something like the Zeta card? https://www.zeta.tech/supercard/
12/16/20, 17:30 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: I think Sodexho now has regular non-food cards too
12/16/20, 17:30 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: No affiliation with them
12/16/20, 17:30 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Then the MDR will be applicable to that fuel merchant
12/16/20, 17:31 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: MDR to a fuel merchant is zero
12/16/20, 17:34 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: This is not a food card..
It js a kind of a gift card, which can be restricted at a MOD and TID level..viz at merchant and POS level
12/16/20, 17:35 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Or maybe the Bharat Petroleum Fleet Card (though I hear they themselves are not promoting it much now)
12/16/20, 17:35 - Vodafone Ketan Pradhan SVP - CVM IIR: Yes.. but Zeta and Sodexo have merged now
12/16/20, 17:36 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: I thought the Sodexho food card was riding on Zeta, but didn't realize they had merged

12/18/20, 17:37 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: Good try
12/18/20, 18:02 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: *FINAL ANSWER TO FIAKS QUEST 104*

The 3 Countries Losing the Most to Tax Abuse are:

*No.1*
IrelandüáÆüá™ (22.6%)

*No.2*
Colombiaüá®üá¥ (18.20%)

*No.3*
Singaporeüá∏üá¨ (10.73%)

*Countries ranking 4th-10th are:*

4. Pakistanüáµüá∞ (9.30%)
5. Angolaüá¶üá¥ (7.36%)
6. Mexico üá≤üáΩ(6.45%)
7. Egypt üá™üá¨(6.14%)
8. Netherlands üá≥üá±(5.43%)
9. United Kingdomüá¨üáß (5.35%)
10. Philippinesüáµüá≠ (4.73%)

(The parentheses indicate the estimated annual losses due to tax abuse as a share of total tax revenue collected.)

When looking at these losses compared to a country's total tax revenue receipts, Ireland, while also a significant facilitator itself, is impacted to one of the highest degrees in the world. The estimated losses incurred via corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion are equivalent to 22 percent of its total annual tax revenue each year. 

As Dr Dereje Alemayehu, poignantly stated: ‚ÄúThe State of Tax Justice 2020 captures global inequality in soberingly stark numbers. Lower income countries lose more than half what they spend on public health every year to tax havens ‚Äì *that‚Äôs enough to cover the annual salaries of nearly 18 million nurses every year*."

The Tax Justice Network is the source of the aforementioned data.

12/22/20, 10:01 - +91 90233 89243: perk? I am actually paying a person a salary in lieu of services that is being offered, how can that be a personal perk? isn't it?
12/22/20, 10:02 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: This message was deleted
12/22/20, 10:03 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: Sorry. Wrong wording.
It‚Äôs personal perk if your company pays for it. Personal expense if you pay for it.

Either way, it‚Äôs personal

Bit debatable in current WFM scenario tho

12/28/20, 23:26 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts on *How is banks, payment companies de-risking SENIOR CITIZENS from FRAUD due to digitisation*_

*View 61* FIAKS Maven 2019&2020

In the current case the money got transferred digitally. If banks or the service provider, can't find the money trail, then they have to pay. *If the recipient money can't find the actual person to whom the account belongs means that KYC is not proper*. Bank should be asked to pay the money + penalize bank for not doing the kyc properly. Get the aadhaar details and blacklist the aadhaar card. *Wherever the aadhaar card is being used catch hold of the person*. Collect the money from that person and credit back the funds to the recipient bank. Until this is done, *no bank will be serious in finding out the details of the person who has done the fraud as banks are not losing money*, and they can put the blame on the senior citizen.

This is a place where TRAI has to pitch in. Currently *True caller gets the details from other persons phone numbers and provides the details to the call receiver on the number from where the person is receiving the call. Is it not possible for TRAI to do this in this digital world ? It is willingness to help the general public that matters*.

I was standing in a branch. One  staff was having a list and was calling each person in the list and was asking "sir, loan chahiye kya". Why RBI or TRAI is not banning this ? Instead have a common website. Ask the person to provide the details in the website. Whichever bank is interested in providing the loan, let them provide the loan. Competition increases and customer benefits.

want to highlight a new cyber crime. 
Fraudsters are calling and asking for COVID-19 vaccine registration. They ask for Aadhar, email id etc. Subsequently to authenticate Aadhar, they ask for OTP. The moment OTP is given, money is siphoned off from Aadhar linked Bank account. 
Please be aware and sensitise.
Regards
12/29/20, 14:45 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Hi. Just read the chat. Banks should take measures such as (1) calling and explaining to senior citizens of the dos, don'ts and consequences; and (2) have better risk rules especially for senior citizens or other groups of individuals who normally do not transact online or do not transact often such as having additional OTP, or immediate automated call that you have initiated a digital transaction for transfer of funds, if you have permitted it press 1. The risk engine should withhold/decline the transaction unless specifically approved.

http://bit.ly/34QnDn5
12/29/20, 15:06 - Prism Jayesh Shah MD & CEO NnR: Banks can do the steps as directed. The main point is who is going to check on the same ? Also, our laws implementation is very poor that all fraudsters get away with the same. As the same in this case of 80 year old person.
If KYC is proper then fraudster account and IP can be easily tracked.  It is not that the law enforcement doesn‚Äôt have expertise but the question whom to prosecute and why ? Since later almost  all criminals get away for some or other reasons. 
Majority of online scams over phone are happening in India. If you complaint your mobile companies then major mobile companies replies in writing that the number is registered in other mobile network and we can not take any action. If you wish you may approach the TRAI and take it further ! 
So when scams are happening, the caller knows these and calls from different networks, so easily not traced. Same thing with the banks. 
So lack of co-ordination of communication and links between banks, mobile and telecom companies, the online scams are happening.

12/29/20, 21:55 - Fintech Arushi Govil Payu NnC: Agreed agreed. There needs to be a wholistic approach in spreading awareness, having risk checks, tracking phone numbers, identifying accounts in which funds have been transferred. Last year I attended a meeting in ministry of home affairs where the cyber police in coordination with trai, RBI, market players, etc discussed in detail about such a portal which was partially built where such fraud complaints would be lodged, and immediately message would get flashed to banks, wallets, phone companies and all other players to act on such complaints. Unfortunately, I am not aware of the status of such portal

RBI and Meity need to take strict action against such incidents and organisation. If SEBI and RBI takes big banks like HDFC, SBI , ICICI for task for outage incidents than magnitude of such incidents are bigger. Ofcourse, spend on Cyber security is not paramount in list of IT budget and always parked as compliance expanses. Board of these organizations need to take such things seriousily and ensure appointment of CISO who faces the public, board, regulators rather than some spokeperson from Corporate communication.

1/8/21, 11:34 - Forum of Industry and Academic Knowledge Sharing: _Digital silver dollar_ : *The digital 'silver dollar': China‚Äôs elderly use tech to boost economic activity*

China is pushing a years-long effort to boost domestic consumption to bring balance to an economy traditionally over-reliant on manufacturing and government investment. E-commerce is a central pillar. Vast and growing amounts of Chinese economic activity are now handled through digital apps that have become part of the fabric of life in modern China, led by Tencent's WeChat Pay and its rival Alipay, run by Alibaba spin-off Ant Group. Together they dominate the huge Chinese online payments industry, typified by shoppers scanning QR codes to make purchases rather than use physical cash, which has become old-fashioned in China.
In November the government called for a nationwide push to "strengthen the ability of the elderly" to use digital tech, urging communities to hold training sessions and developers to create elderly-friendly apps. This has become even more imperative in the era of the coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

- As you can logically conclude since the banks are paying borrowers to take loans, there is actually a charge taken, when you put deposits 
- These are extreme measures taken by central banks when they feel that economy is on a downward spiral and they need to incentivise spends (think of cashbacks :) to pump money in the countrys economy

1/8/21, 22:24 - Fintech Netpay Ajay Founder NnC: also, would like to know views on below topic;

the last decade was mostly about unbundling of finance/banking, and the rise of startups focussed on specialised niches.

now, the reverse seems to be happening since most fintech startups that reach some scale, have started adding more and more services, and becoming like your pre-2010 banks, again.

That's a thread of  comments from the head of WhatsApp.

In essence, he says, nothing has *changed* with the messages. They are still encrypted end to end, so no one, including fb has access to it's content.

Apparently, the policy change is for WhatsApp payments and WhatsApp business interactions.

1/11/21, 18:46 - Vikas Business Phone: <245> FIAKS community Debates tonight on  *Sponsor bank arrangement with tech companies & Future of POS Manufacturing companies* 

Community member says we had discussions sometime back on companies like Google or What‚Äôs app  blacklisting your country or individual. Looklike they have done in a different form. Whatsapp is saying  *take-it-or-leave-it* choice is yours. Either your *data goes to Facebook, or you're out*

Whatsapp services are free and they are  absolutely right to monetise it‚Äôs platform.. as businesses is  not done for charity.

*Question 1* : Are we doing mistake   of allowing *GOOGLE, WHATSAPP, TRUECALLERS, INSTAGRAM* etc  kind of companies in banking & payment space. Why India wants to be 1st? Why can‚Äôt we be 3rd or 4th here?

*Question 2* Facebook did *not* mention *Jio Payments Bank* and instead listed ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and the State Bank of India as the four banks powering payments through the app. Why?

*Question 3* Do *POS machine* manufacturing industry have any future especially with Whats app entry and after covid?


_Invite your views and guidance on this subject_

üî¥IMPORTANT

1/11/21, 18:46 - Vikas Business Phone: _FIAKS Bespoke_ *What If WhatsApp and Google Blacklist A Particular Country?*

The entire country will be dependent on WhatsApp & Google with no backup or alternative plans, isn‚Äôt it?

So, no bank needed(they are already offering few banking services), no NPCI needed(NUE), no RBI/regulator needed (Cryptocurrency), no telecom needed as they offer voice and messaging services too!! 

Are we understanding the risk here? Risk is at- _country level, company level, and individual level_

1/11/21, 18:52 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: We got sharechat-10 crores users & jiochat-5 crores...both are indian apps
1/11/21, 18:58 - Nearex Arun Tanksali CTO NnR: Q1 : This seems a rather dangerous mentality. "Allow" implies some kind of License Raj, and we know how that works.  In any case, different flavors of license already exist - with different constraints and permissions. There is a class - the App provider - which fortunately does not require anything. The system is designed to protect consumers from a disaster. Neither Google nor Whatsapp nor PhonePe hold end user funds. If they all disappear tomorrow, there won't be any problem greater than that of inconvenience. We will back to the age a scant 5 years ago when convenience of the kind today can only be dreamt of. I think the approach should be to invite even more people - bring on competition and let the consumer choose.

Q2 : Why should anyone other than Facebook or Jio be privy to this answer?

Q3 : They were already having a tough time. Verifone and Ingenico went through a change of hands mostly due to the arrival of the commoditized Chinese POS and well before either the Pandemic or app based payments. But they also evolve ... at least the more innovative ones.
1/11/21, 19:31 - Transact Services Muthukrishnan GM Sales Ref Jack NnR: Question-3...there is a time when barcode machines, then hypercom, Lipman n Verifone pstn terminals were ruling the pos industry, then came ingenico pstn terminals, after that Verifone introduced gprs terminals,market dynamics changed thereafter, ingenico too introduced gprs, then the android terminals been introduced by Chinese companies...but then ingenico and Verifone still rule with their gprs/pstn terminals updating regularly with the market requirement of UPI n bharat qr within Pos terminals.they do support all samsung pay, amazon pay etc.
As long as physical card is available in the market, the requirement of POS terminals will be there, chinese terminals are only fancy devices but no self life, which is evident in the market...
  When physical card issuance get stopped, pos terminals requirement will slowly goes down..
Otherwise UPI/Qr payments will be only an alternative mode of payment, one will not replace another, probably market share may change according to the user experience and geographies.....

Big tech entering payments - protectionism in any form will only stifle innovation. The question needs to reframed to not single out big tech but to ask how can every payment provider have a level playing field and participate in the public goods that are being built. Ultimately, these platforms are only adding a convenience layer to the existing system and not replacing it. 

Yes, if regulator started allowing them to function like a wallet for p2p payments then it‚Äôs a different ballgame. But these platforms are payment processing tech and not wallets. 

Nothing stops Whatspp from launching a WhatsApp Card in the future and linking it with WhatsApp Pay. That then is a different product and will have it‚Äôs own set of regulations.

*View 39* _Future of POS_
POS Machines will survive either until alternate interaction modes like QR Code/NFC etc takes full precedence or till people reduce the usage of Chip based Credit/Debit Cards.They surely survive for next 5 to 8 years by when, NFC will surely happen in every phone, and UPI multiplying it's presence in India & abroad when the duo will make card & pos machine combination less lucrative (with acquirer banks charging around Rs.500/month for pos machine), and while NFC cards might still be used with NFC enabled mobile phone (in the hands of merchants), *POS Machine is sure to go off thereafter gradually*.

Market concentration is key. Not  whether foreign firms should have unfettered power in market. 
Has anyone done a *CR4 + Hefindahl-Hirschman index calculation* to measure if there is unnatural  concentration of market power in few firm? With that one can make a case for ensuring  fair and competitive  market space in Payments...both domestic and overseas players.


*FAB Query* What is CR4 + hefidahl-hirschman ? 

The Herfindahl index (also known as Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index, HHI, or sometimes HHI-score) is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrustand also technology management.

1/12/21, 07:54 - +91 90233 89243: Q1 - As far as they just act as a facilitator and are a pass-through without storing any PII and PCI data ( Which I am sure they should not be allowed) , I guess we should be fine since they will be acting as just another interface provider, though the 'reach' is a surely an issue which can limit the competition. 
Q3 - POS is not going to die anytime soon, however they will need to innovate and keep bringing value additions on top of what the actual PoS was supposed to do ,  just for e.g. if the POS can be integrated with speaker instead of a paper receipt , which technically will reduce time of transaction as well I guess cost of production..

Also NFC is a great use case of POS to remain alive , but only time will tell.

1/15/21, 22:16 - Fintech Easy2lend Riaz Maniyar NnR: *Piramal Group has emerged as the preferred bidder for beleaguered mortgage lender*

Dewan Housing Finance Corporation¬†(DHFL) at the end of voting by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) on January 15, according to a person familiar with the development.

‚ÄúCoC is understood to have favoured the Piramals,‚Äù said the person who is intimately aware of the bidding process. The person didn't want to be named.

According to another person in the know, the Piramals have got over 94 percent votes, way above the minimum 66 percent votes required.

Oaktree has secured around 45 percent votes, according to the person quoted above. Oaktree's total bid for DHFL stood at Rs38,400 crore against Piramal's Rs37, 250 crore. But Piramal's offer had higher upfront cash payment that is likely to have appealed to the creditors.

Also, according to sources, Piramal being a local firm would have helped it find favour from the DHFL creditors.
The CoC will now formally meet again and DHFL administrator will declare the result.

The bidding war for DHFL has been going on for a while with Piramal Group and Oaktree Capital leading the race in the final round.¬†Piramal Enterprises, a diversified Indian conglomerate, and American asset management company Oaktree have both made bids in the range of Rs 37,000-38,000 crore. 

The cash components are also almost identical, at about Rs 17,000 crore each.

Throughout the bidding process, Piramals had contested strongly that its bid has an upper hand over Okatree¬†for a range of reasons.

Besides the financial aspects, creditors also evaluated the non-financial part of the bids such as regulatory compliance, company track records and future action plan etc, according to officials who are in the know.
Piramal has a clear edge over Oaktree in the race,¬†Moneycontrol¬†had¬†reported earlier.

DHFL collapsed under the weight of a severe liquidity crunch after the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in late 2018 and couldn't recover from the low point subsequently.

Adding to its woes, investigations were launched against the Wadhawans on various charges relating to financial irregularities and unholy nexus with the underworld in relation to certain real estate transactions. Subsequently, DHFL was pushed to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in December 2019. Since then, the creditors to the company have been attempting for a resolution.

*DHFL owes around Rs 91,000 crore to its creditors.¬†State Bank of India¬†is the biggest creditor to DHFL with an exposure of around Rs 10,000 crore. Other lenders include Bank of India, Canara Bank, NHB, Union Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, and Bank of Baroda*

Whether it is icici , axis or hdfc or kotak or  IndusInd, everyone will go through some technology failures at one point or another.  As far as the current problems of icici and hdfc are concerned, I think the exponential growth of electronic payments after  *IMPS and UPI is the root cause*.. This is a case of hardware and middleware not keeping pace with the software evolution. *Several banks and nbfcs have started doing penny drop txns periodically to check the validity of account numbers* . This itself will push up txns volumes greatly though these as essentially dummy txns. 

*Policy Advocacy recommendations by FIAKS Maven*

I believe it is time to segregate very low value payments (below 1000) from other txns and route them through a parallel payment rail.
1/17/21, 21:51 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community CXO Experts on ICICI BANK Outage & *Are regulators depending on banks to share reports*_

*View 43*

That banks are a highly governed entities, may be an understatement actually.

There are multiple layers of governance at management and board levels, and 100% auditable documents are generated for aberrations in functioning of critical KPIs ‚Äî whether or not a customer/ market/ press reports them ... *this cannot escape scrutiny*.
1/17/21, 23:02 - Vikas Business Phone: _Intellectual Speaks:FIAKS Community Experts blames it *cancerous unplanned digitalisation growth* for all such outages_

*View 76* : CXO Banker
There is not that much revenue for banks with UPI or IMPS, but still they have to maintain a good infra considering the huge volume of transactions. This eats up the infra of other payment systems also. There should be a limit on number of UPI transactions per day for each customer. If we see in many public sector banks, opening and closing balance of many accounts will be less than 100, there will be many transactions through out the day. Bank can't charge these customers also as these are as per government norms not to be charged. *There should be some regulation to be brought in*. Most of the banks are bleeding on these transactions. Until there is a governance on these transactions, it will be difficult.

1/18/21, 11:51 - Vikas Business Phone: Members today, Payments industry and FIAKS community has lost a great contributor, a thought leader and a good human being. *Mr Paresh Rajde* 

We are paying tribute to Paresh ji by posting  some of the update as shared by several senior leaders in  the community on Mr Paresh Rajde great contributions to India's Payments Industry. Mr Paresh was instrumental in *RBI approving "for-profit Companies being appointed as BCs of Banks". Paresh pioneered the famous CASH2BANK Domestic Money Transfer (DMT) model, teaming up with Private Bank, which has now grown to be a huge industry by itself, today.*

Mr Paresh Rajde has made several pioneering contributions in the business of connecting the last mile and providing neighbourhood convenience i.e., making available the utility and bill payments services to the common man. Paresh was the first to connect with the Indian Railways for issuing tickets through Kirana stores which was later opened up to others. Railway Ticketing as a Service created huge entrepreneurial opportunities across the country besides the convenience it provided to the common man. 

Mr Paresh had very humble beginnings coming from the land of Kutch (Gujarat)...he was ever inspired by his Father's simple approach to life, which made to stay grounded always. To almost everyone, he always came across as a calm and composed with a smile. He was ever accessible and had an open-door policy for his employees.

May God give enough strength to his family members to bear this irreparable loss. May his soul rest in peace.üôè
